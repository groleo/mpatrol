@unnumbered Foreword
@cindex foreword

I first started writing this library a few years ago when the company I work for
sent me out to a customer who had reported a memory leak, which he expected was
coming from the code generated by our C++ compiler.  A few years on and the
library has changed dramatically from its first beginnings, but I thought I'd
release it publicly in case anyone else found it useful.

When writing the library, I placed more emphasis on the quantity and quality of
information about allocated memory rather than the speed and efficiency of
allocating the actual memory.  This means that the library will use dramatically
more memory than normal dynamic memory allocation libraries and can slow down to
a crawl depending on which options you use.  However, the end results are likely
to be accurate and reliable, and in most cases the library will run quite
happily at a sane speed.

@cindex warranty
The mpatrol library is by no means the only library of its kind.  Solaris 7 has
no less that 6 different malloc libraries, and there are plenty available as
freeware or as commercial products.  Try to keep in mind that mpatrol comes with
absolutely no warranty and so if it doesn't work for you and you need a fast
solution, try some of the other libraries or products available.  I have listed
some of the most popular at the end of this manual (@pxref{Related software}).

@cindex manual layout
This manual is arranged so that complete reference material on the mpatrol
library can be found in the appendices, while introductory and background
material can be found in the preceding chapters and sections.  For readers who
wish to delve right in and use the library, the Installation
(@pxref{Installation}) and Examples (@pxref{Examples}) chapters should be enough
to get started in combination with the quick reference card.  Otherwise, this
manual should be read from beginning to end in order to get the most out of the
software it describes.

@cindex bug reports
@cindex reporting bugs
@cindex FAQ
Due to their very nature, problems with dynamic memory allocations are
notoriously difficult to reproduce and debug, and this is likely to be the case
if you find a bug in the mpatrol library as it might be extremely hard to
reproduce on another system.  Details on how to report bugs are given elsewhere
in this document (@pxref{Notes}), but it would be very useful if you could try
to provide as much information as possible when reporting a problem, and that
includes having a look in the library source code to see if it's obvious what is
wrong.  However, please try to read the FAQ first in case your question or
problem is covered there since it is usually updated every time I receive a
question about mpatrol.

@cindex updates
@cindex FreshMeat
The latest version of the mpatrol library and this manual can always be found at
@uref{http://www.cbmamiga.demon.co.uk/mpatrol/}, and any correspondence relating
to mpatrol (bug reports, enhancement requests, compliments, etc.) should be sent
to @email{mpatrol@@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk}.  The mpatrol library is also
registered at FreshMeat (@uref{http://freshmeat.net/}) so you can receive
notification of updates there as well.  I normally only check my e-mail about
once or twice a week, so don't expect an immediate response.  I can also be
reached at @email{graeme@@epc.co.uk} but that is my work e-mail address.  There
is now also a discussion group at @uref{http://www.egroups.com/group/mpatrol/}
where you can post mpatrol-related questions but you must first subscribe to the
group before you can send mail to it.

@cindex references
Note that this manual is not just intended to instruct readers on how to use the
mpatrol library --- it is also written to give a detailed look at how malloc
libraries work in general and how to improve the efficiency of existing code
which uses them.  If this subject interests you, you may find further useful
material at @emph{The Memory Management Reference} located at
@uref{http://www.harlequin.com/mm/reference/}.  It has links to many documents
and research papers in the field of memory management, and has a large glossary
which lists and explains related terms.  You may also wish to look at
@emph{A Memory Allocator} by Doug Lea for information on general memory
allocation principles.  It is located at
@uref{http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html}.

@cindex acknowledgements
@cindex contributors
Finally, I'd like to thank Stephan Springl (@email{springl@@bfw-online.de}) for
his help on reading debugging information from object files via the GNU BFD
library, and Dave Gibson (@email{david@@epc.co.uk}) for his help on writing
thread-safe code.  Calum Wilkie (@email{calum@@epc.co.uk}) also deserves a
mention since the idea for providing stack traces comes from a similar library
he wrote a few years ago.

@cindex release builds
Oh, and always remember to do final release builds without the mpatrol library
as the library is much slower than normal malloc implementations and uses much
more memory.

Happy debugging!

@chapter Overview
@cindex overview

@cindex mpatrol
@cindex mpatrol library
@cindex library, mpatrol
@cindex run-time errors
@cindex errors, run-time
The mpatrol library is yet another link library that attempts to diagnose
run-time errors that are caused by the wrong use of dynamically allocated
memory.  If you don't know what the @code{malloc()} function or @code{operator
new[]} do then this library is probably not for you.  You have to have a certain
amount of programming expertise and a knowledge of how to run a command line
compiler and linker before you should attempt to use this.

Along with providing a comprehensive and configurable log of all dynamic memory
operations that occurred during the lifetime of a program, the mpatrol library
performs extensive checking to detect any misuse of dynamically allocated
memory.  All of this functionality can be integrated into existing code through
the inclusion of a single header file at compile-time.  On UNIX and Windows
platforms (and AmigaOS when using @command{gcc}) this may not even be necessary
as the mpatrol library can be linked with existing object files at link-time or,
on some platforms, even dynamically linked with existing programs at run-time.

All logging and tracing output from the mpatrol library is sent to a separate
log file in order to keep its diagnostics separate from any that the program
being tested might generate.  A wide variety of library settings can also be
changed at run-time via an environment variable, thus removing the need to
recompile or relink in order to change the library's behaviour.

A file containing a summary of the memory allocation profiling statistics for a
particular program can be produced by the mpatrol library.  This file can then
be read by a profiling tool which will display a set of tables based upon the
accumulated data.  The profiling information includes summaries of all of the
memory allocations listed by size and the function that allocated them and a
list of memory leaks with the call stack of the allocating function.

The mpatrol library has been designed with the intention of replacing calls to
existing C and C++ memory allocation functions as seamlessly as possible, but
in many cases that may not be possible and slight code modifications may be
required.  However, a preprocessor macro containing the version of the mpatrol
library is provided for the purposes of conditional compilation so that release
builds and debug builds can be easily automated.

@chapter Features
@cindex mpatrol features
@cindex features

An overall list of features contained in the mpatrol library is given below.
This is not intended to be exhaustive since the best way to see what the library
does is to read the documentation and try it out.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Written for UNIX, AmigaOS, Windows and Netware platforms.

@item
Can be built to allocate memory from a fixed-sized static array rather than
using heap memory from the system.

@cindex archive library
@cindex library, archive
@cindex shared library
@cindex library, shared
@cindex thread-safe library
@cindex library, thread-safe
@item
Can be built as archive, shared and/or thread-safe libraries on systems that
support them, or even as one large object file.  A lint library can also be
built from the mpatrol library on UNIX platforms.

@item
Details of memory allocations and free memory are stored internally as a tree
structure for speed and also to allow the best fit allocation algorithm to be
used.  This also enables the library to perform intelligent resizing of memory
allocations and can be used to quickly determine if an address has been
allocated on the heap.

@item
Contains 14 replacement C dynamic memory allocation functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .1 .7
@item @code{malloc()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Allocates memory.
@item @code{calloc()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Allocates zero-filled memory.
@item @code{memalign()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Allocates memory with a specified alignment.
@item @code{valloc()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Allocates page-aligned memory.
@item @code{pvalloc()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Allocates a number of pages.
@item @code{strdup()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Duplicates a string.
@item @code{strndup()}
@tab old
@tab Duplicates a string with a maximum length.
@item @code{strsave()}
@tab old
@tab Duplicates a string.
@item @code{strnsave()}
@tab old
@tab Duplicates a string with a maximum length.
@item @code{realloc()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Resizes memory.
@item @code{recalloc()}
@tab old
@tab Resizes memory allocated by @code{calloc()}.
@item @code{expand()}
@tab old
@tab Resizes memory but does not relocate it.
@item @code{free()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Frees memory.
@item @code{cfree()}
@tab old
@tab Frees memory allocated by @code{calloc()}.
@end multitable

@item
Contains 4 replacement C++ dynamic memory allocation functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .7
@item @code{operator new}
@tab Allocates memory.
@item @code{operator new[]}
@tab Allocates memory for an array.
@item @code{operator delete}
@tab Frees memory.
@item @code{operator delete[]}
@tab Frees memory allocated by @code{operator new[]}.
@end multitable

@item
Contains 10 replacement C memory operation functions:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .1 .7
@item @code{memset()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Fills memory with a specific byte.
@item @code{bzero()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Fills memory with the zero byte.
@item @code{memccpy()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Copies memory up to a specific byte.
@item @code{memcpy()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Copies non-overlapping memory.
@item @code{memmove()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Copies possibly-overlapping memory.
@item @code{bcopy()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Copies possibly-overlapping memory.
@item @code{memcmp()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Compares two blocks of memory.
@item @code{bcmp()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Compares two blocks of memory.
@item @code{memchr()}
@tab ANSI
@tab Searches memory for a specific byte.
@item @code{memmem()}
@tab UNIX
@tab Searches memory for specific bytes.
@end multitable

@item
All of the above functions can also be defined with an additional underscore
prepended to their external name in order to catch all uses of these functions
in the system and third-party libraries.

@item
Contains support for a user-defined low-memory handler function, including a
replacement for the C++ function, @code{set_new_handler()}.

@item
Contains support for user-defined prologue and epilogue callback functions,
which get called before and after every memory allocation, reallocation or
deallocation.

@item
A function is provided to return as much information as possible about a given
memory allocation, and can be called at any time during program execution.  A
similar function is also provided for calling from within a debugger and an
example command file is provided for use with @command{gdb}.

@item
A function is provided to display library settings and heap usage statistics,
including peak memory usage.  This information is also displayed at program
termination.

@item
The library reads any user-controllable options at run-time from an environment
variable, but this does not have to be set as defaults will then be used.  This
prevents having to recompile anything in order to change any library settings.
An option exists to display a quick-reference summary of all of the recognised
options to the standard error file stream.

@item
All diagnostics and logging are sent to a file in the current directory, but
this can be overridden, including forcing the log file to be the standard output
or standard error file streams.

@item
Options exist to log details of every memory allocation, reallocation or
deallocation when they occur.

@item
Options exist to halt the program at a specific memory allocation, reallocation
or deallocation when running the program within a debugger.  These options have
no effect when running the program without a debugger.

@item
An option exists to enable memory allocation profiling, which forces a summary
of all memory allocation statistics to be written to a specified file for later
use by a profiling command.  The profiling file can also be written at a
specified frequency.

@item
A profiling command is provided which reads a profiling output file produced by
the mpatrol library and displays a set of tables based on the accumulated data.
The profiling information includes summaries of all of the memory allocations
listed by size and the function that allocated them and a list of memory leaks
with the call stack of the allocating function.

@item
On UNIX platforms, the @code{mmap()} function can optionally be used to allocate
memory instead of the @code{sbrk()} function, but only if the system supports
it.  This can be useful if the mpatrol library clashes with another malloc
library that uses @code{sbrk()} to allocate heap memory.

@item
On non-UNIX platforms where the mpatrol library overrides @code{malloc()}
without requiring the inclusion of @file{mpatrol.h}, versions of the UNIX
functions @code{brk()} and @code{sbrk()} are provided for compatibility with
certain libraries.  These should @emph{not} be called by user code as they have
only limited functionality.

@item
All newly-allocated memory that is not allocated by the @code{calloc()} or
@code{recalloc()} functions will be pre-filled with a non-zero value in order to
catch out programs that wrongly assume that all newly-allocated memory is
zeroed.  This value can be modified at run-time.

@item
Can automatically check to see if there have been any illegal writes to bytes
located just before and after every memory allocation through the use of
overflow buffers.  The size of such overflow buffers and the value to pre-fill
them with can be modified at run-time.  The checks will be performed before
every memory allocation call to ensure that nothing has overwritten the
overflow buffers, but a function is also provided to perform additional checks
under the programmer's control and an option exists to specify a range in which
checks will be performed.

@item
On systems that support them, watch point areas can be used instead of overflow
buffers so that every read and write to memory is checked to ensure that it is
not within an overflow buffer.

@item
Can automatically check to see if there have been any illegal writes to free
memory blocks.  The value to pre-fill free memory blocks with can be modified
at run-time.  The check will be performed before every memory allocation call
to ensure that nothing has overwritten the free memory block, but a function is
also provided to perform additional checks under the programmer's control and
an option exists to specify a range in which checks will be performed.

@item
On systems that support memory protection, every memory allocation can
optionally be allocated at least one page of memory.  That way, any free memory
blocks can be made read and write protected so that nothing can access free
memory on the heap.  An option is provided to specify whether all memory
allocations should be allocated at the start or at the end of such pages, and
the bytes left over within the pages become overflow buffers.

@item
All freed memory allocations can optionally be prevented from being returned to
the free memory pool.  This is useful for detecting if use is being made of
freed memory just after a memory allocation has been freed.  The contents of
the memory allocation can either be preserved or can be pre-filled with a value
in order to detect illegal writes to the freed memory allocation.

@item
Calls to memory operation functions (such as @code{memset()} or @code{memcpy()})
have their arguments checked to ensure that they do not pass null pointers or
attempt to read or write memory straddling the boundary of a previously
allocated memory block, although an option exists to turn such an error into a
warning so that the operation can still be performed.  Tracing from all such
functions can also optionally be written to the log file.

@item
The internal data structures used by the library are kept separate from the
rest of the memory allocations.  On systems that support memory protection, all
of these internal data structures will be write-protected in order to prevent
corruption by the calling program.  This feature can be overridden at run-time
as it can slow the program down.

@cindex signals
@item
Certain signals can be saved and restored on entry to each library function and
@code{errno} is set to @code{ENOMEM} if memory cannot be allocated.

@item
On systems that support memory protection, the library attempts to detect any
illegal memory accesses and display as much information as it can obtain about
the address in question and where the illegal memory access occurred.

@item
A call stack traceback from any function performing a memory allocation is
stored if the library supports this feature on the system it is being run on.
This information can then be displayed when information about a specific memory
allocation is required.  Two different call stack traceback implementations are
provided.

@item
Symbol table details from executable files and shared libraries are
automatically read on systems that support this feature in order to make the
call stack tracebacks more meaningful.  An option also exists to display a
complete list of the symbols that were read by the library at program
termination.

@item
Compiler-generated line number tables from any debugging sections that exist
in executable files and shared libraries can also be used by the mpatrol library
in order to provide more meaningful information in call stack tracebacks.

@item
If the library is unable to automatically determine a program's executable
filename to read symbols from then an option exists to specify the full path to
the program's executable file.

@item
An option exists to change the default alignment used for general-purpose memory
allocations.

@item
Contains support for a user-defined limit to available memory which can be
useful for stress-testing a program in simulated low memory conditions.

@item
Contains a feature to randomly fail a specific frequency of memory allocations
which can be useful for stress-testing error recovery code in a program.

@item
An option exists to display a complete memory map of the heap at program
termination.  A function to do this is also available to call at any point
during program execution.

@item
Options exist to display all freed and unfreed memory allocations at program
termination in order to detect memory leaks.  A separate program is also
provided for locating memory leaks in unfinished log files.

@item
An option exists to abort the program with a failure condition if there are more
than a specified number of unfreed memory allocations at program termination.
This could be useful for batch testing in order to check that all tests free up
most of their allocated memory.

@item
Functions always report if their arguments are illegal in order to pinpoint any
errors, and options exist to perform rigorous checking of arguments when
allocating, reallocating and freeing memory.  In addition, checking is performed
to ensure that memory allocated by @code{operator new[]} is not freed with
@code{free()} for example.

@item
The type of function performing a memory allocation is always stored along with
the allocation, as well as the file and line number it was called from.  If
compiled with @command{gcc}, the function name will also be stored and the
thread identifier will be stored if using the thread-safe library.

@item
The library uses a header file to redefine the memory allocation functions as
macros in order to obtain more information about where they were called from.
This is not strictly required on UNIX and Windows platforms (and AmigaOS when
using @command{gcc}), since the library automatically redefines the default
system memory allocation functions.  All redefinitions in the header can also
be disabled by defining the @code{NDEBUG} preprocessor macro.

@item
A command is supplied to run a program that was linked with the mpatrol library
with any specified options on the command line.  On some UNIX platforms, an
option also exists to override the default memory allocation routines for any
dynamically-linked program that was not previously linked with the mpatrol
library.

@item
The mpatrol library can be built to liaise with Parasoft Inuse, a commercial
graphical memory usage tool that can display the current memory map of a running
process.  Inuse is supplied with Parasoft Insure++.

@cindex test suite
@item
A small test suite is provided in order to test basic features.

@item
User documentation is currently available in @TeX{}info format as well as UNIX
manual pages and a quick reference card.

@chapter Installation
@cindex installation
@cindex building the library
@cindex library, building

@cindex Amiga 4000/040
The mpatrol library was initially developed on an Amiga 4000/040 running AmigaOS
3.1.  I then installed RedHat Linux 5.1 on my Amiga and added support for
Linux/m68k.  I've tried my best to make it as easy as possible to build and
install mpatrol on any system, but it isn't likely to run smoothly for
everybody.  However, there shouldn't be any major problems if you perform the
following steps.

@enumerate 1
@item
Go into the @file{build} directory and then into the appropriate subdirectory
for your system.

@cindex Makefile
@cindex CC
@cindex AR
@cindex LD
@cindex CFLAGS
@cindex OFLAGS
@cindex SFLAGS
@cindex TFLAGS
@cindex compiling
@cindex compiler
@cindex linking
@cindex linker
@cindex optimisation
@item
Edit the @file{Makefile} in that directory and check that it is using the
appropriate compiler and build tools.  The @code{CC} macro specifies the
compiler, the @code{AR} macro specifies the tool used to build the archive
library and the @code{LD} macro specifies the tool to build the shared library.
The @code{CFLAGS} macro specifies compiler options that are always to be used,
the @code{OFLAGS} macro specifies optimisation options for the compiler, the
@code{SFLAGS} macro specifies options to be passed to the compiler when building
a shared library and the @code{TFLAGS} macro specifies options to be passed to
the compiler when building a thread-safe library.  You may also need to change
the library names and library build commands on different systems.

@cindex make
@cindex all (make target)
@cindex lint (make target)
@cindex clean (make target)
@cindex clobber (make target)
@cindex lint
@item
Use the @command{make} command (or equivalent) to build the mpatrol library in
archive form.  The @samp{all} target builds all possible combinations of the
mpatrol library for your system.  The @samp{clean} target removes all relevant
object files from the current directory, while the @samp{clobber} target also
removes all libraries that have been built from the current directory.  On some
UNIX platforms, the @samp{lint} target will build a @command{lint} library for
the mpatrol library.

@cindex Inuse
@item
If the mpatrol library is to be built with support for Parasoft Inuse then the
@code{MP_INUSE_SUPPORT} preprocessor macro must be defined in the
@code{CFLAGS} portion of the @file{Makefile} before building.  This will ensure
that Inuse will be notified of every memory allocation, reallocation and
deallocation, but the Insure++ runtime library will also have to be linked in
with any program that uses mpatrol.

@cindex symbolic links
@cindex links, symbolic
@item
Copy all of the libraries that have been built into your local library
directory.  If there were symbolic links created in the @file{build} directory
then these should be recreated in the local library directory rather than simply
copying them.

@item
Copy the @command{mpatrol}, @command{mprof} and @command{mleak} programs that
have been built into your local bin directory.

@item
Go up two directory levels into the @file{src} directory and copy the
@file{mpatrol.h} header file into your local include directory.

@cindex manual pages
@item
On UNIX platforms, go up one directory level into the @file{man} directory and
copy the @file{man1} and @file{man3} subdirectories to your local man directory.
Unfortunately, the location for manual pages varies from system to system so you
may or may not also be able to copy the @file{cat1} and @file{cat3}
subdirectories as well.  The @file{man*} subdirectories contain the unformatted
manual pages while the @file{cat*} subdirectories contain the formatted manual
pages.

@cindex @TeX{}info
@cindex La@TeX{}
@cindex documentation
@cindex reference card
@cindex quick reference card
@cindex printing

@cindex recompilation
The following steps should allow you to easily integrate the mpatrol library
into an existing application, although some of them may not be available to do
on many platforms.  They are listed in the order of number of changes required
to modify existing code --- the last step will require a complete recompilation
of all your code.

@enumerate 1
@item
This step is currently only available on IRIX, Linux and Solaris platforms and
on DG/UX 4.20MU07 or later platforms with the @env{LD_PRELOAD} feature.

If your program or application has been dynamically linked with the system C
library (@file{libc.so}) or an alternative malloc shared library then you can
use the @option{-d} option to the @file{mpatrol} command to override the default
definitions of @code{malloc()}, etc. at run-time without having to relink your
program.

For example, if your program's executable file is called @file{testprog} and it
accepts an option specifying an input file, you can force the system's dynamic
linker to use mpatrol's versions of @code{malloc()}, etc. instead of the default
versions by typing:

@smallexample
mpatrol -d ./testprog -i file
@end smallexample

The resulting log file should be called @file{mpatrol.<procid>.log} by default
(where @var{procid} is the current process id), but if no such file exists after
running the @file{mpatrol} command then it will not be possible to force the
run-time linking of mpatrol functions to your program and you will have to
proceed to the next step.

@item
This step is currently only available on UNIX and Windows platforms (and AmigaOS
when using @command{gcc}).

You should be able to link in the mpatrol library when linking your program
without having to recompile any of your object files or libraries, but this will
only be worthwhile on systems where stack tracebacks are supported, otherwise
you should proceed to the next step since there will not be enough information
for you to tell where the calls to dynamic memory allocation functions took
place.

Information on how to link the mpatrol library to an application is given at the
start of the examples (@pxref{Examples}), but you should note that if your
program does not directly call any of the functions in the mpatrol library then
it will not be linked in and you will not see a log file being generated when
you run it.  You can force the linking of the mpatrol library by causing
@code{malloc()} to be undefined on the link line, usually through the use of the
@option{-u} linker option.

@item
All of the following steps will require you to recompile some or all of your
code so that your code calls dynamic memory allocation functions from the
mpatrol library rather than the system C library.

For this step, if you have a rough idea of where the function calls lie that you
would like to trace or test, you need only recompile the relevant source files.
You should modify these source files to include the @file{mpatrol.h} header file
before any calls to dynamic memory allocation or memory operation functions.

However, you should take particular care to ensure that all calls to memory
allocation functions in the mpatrol library will be matched by calls to memory
reallocation or deallocation functions in the mpatrol library, since if they are
unmatched then the log file will either fill up with errors complaining about
trying to free unknown allocations, or warnings about unfreed memory allocations
at the end of execution.

@item
This step requires you to recompile all of your source files to include the
@file{mpatrol.h} header file.  Obviously, this will take the longest amount of
time to integrate, but need not require you to change any source files if the
compiler you are using has a command line option to include a specific header
file before any source files.

For example, @command{gcc} comes with a @option{-include} option which has this
feature, so if you had to recompile a source file called @file{test.c} then the
following command would allow you to include @file{mpatrol.h} without having
to modify the source file:

@smallexample
gcc -include /usr/local/include/mpatrol.h -c test.c
@end smallexample
@end enumerate

In all cases, it will be desirable to compile your source files with
compiler-generated debugging information since that may be able to be used by
the @option{USEDEBUG} option.  In addition, more symbolic information will be
available if the executable files have not had their symbol tables stripped
from them, although mpatrol can also fall back to using the dynamic symbol
table from dynamically linked executable files.

@cindex memory allocations

@cindex C
@cindex C++
@cindex Pascal
@cindex BASIC
@cindex FORTRAN
In the C and C++ programming languages there are generally three different types
of memory allocation that can be used to hold the contents of variables.  Other
programming languages such as Pascal, BASIC and FORTRAN also support some of
these types of allocation, although their implementations may be slightly
different.

@menu
* Static memory allocations::   Fixed location, fixed size.

@section Static memory allocations
@cindex static memory allocations
@cindex memory allocations, static

@cindex file scope variables
@cindex variables, file scope
@cindex local static variables
@cindex variables, local static
The first type of memory allocation is known as a @emph{static memory
allocation}, which corresponds to file scope variables and local static
variables.  The addresses and sizes of these allocations are fixed at the time
of compilation@footnote{Or more accurately, at link time.} and so they can be
placed in a fixed-sized data area which then corresponds to a section within the
final linked executable file.  Such memory allocations are called static because
they do not vary in location or size during the lifetime of the program.

@cindex data sections
@cindex sections
@cindex BSS
There can be many types of data sections within an executable file; the three
most common are normal data, BSS data and read-only data.  BSS data contains
variables and arrays which are to be initialised to zero at run-time and so is
treated as a special case, since the actual contents of the section need not be
stored in the executable file.  Read-only data consists of constant variables
and arrays whose contents are guaranteed not to change when a program is being
run.  For example, on a typical SVR4 UNIX system the following variable
definitions would result in them being placed in the following sections:

@smallexample
int a;           /* BSS data */
int b = 1;       /* normal data */
const int c = 2; /* read-only data */
@end smallexample

@cindex tentative declarations
@cindex declarations, tentative
@cindex common variables
In C the first example would be considered a @emph{tentative} declaration, and
if there was no subsequent definition of that variable in the current
translation unit then it would become a @emph{common} variable in the resulting
object file.  When the object file gets linked with other object files, any
common variables with the same name become one variable, or take their
definition from a non-tentative definition of that variable.  In the former
case, the variable is placed in the BSS section.  Note that C++ has no support
for tentative declarations.

As all static memory allocations have sizes and address offsets that are known
at compile-time and are explicitly initialised, there is very little that can go
wrong with them.  Data can be read or written past the end of such variables,
but that is a common problem with all memory allocations and is generally easy
to locate in that case.  On systems that separate read-only data from normal
data, writing to a read-only variable can be quickly diagnosed at run-time.

@cindex parameter variables
@cindex variables, parameter
@cindex call-by-value
@cindex non-static local variables
@cindex variables, non-static local
The second type of memory allocation is known as a @emph{stack memory
allocation}, which corresponds to non-static local variables and call-by-value
parameter variables.  The sizes of these allocations are fixed at the time of
compilation but their addresses will vary depending on when the function which
defines them is called.  Their contents are not immediately initialised, and
must be explicitly initialised by the programmer upon entry to the function or
when they become visible in scope.

@cindex stack
@cindex registers
Such memory allocations are placed in a system memory area called the
@emph{stack}, which is allocated per process@footnote{Or per thread on some
systems.} and generally grows down in memory.  When a function is called, the
state of the calling function must be preserved so that when the called function
returns, the calling function can resume execution.  That state is stored on the
stack, including all local variables and parameters.  The compiler generates
code to increase the size of the stack upon entry to a function, and decrease
the size of the stack upon exit from a function, as well as saving and restoring
the values of registers.

There are a few common problems using stack memory allocations, and most
generally involve uninitialised variables, which a good compiler can usually
diagnose at compile-time.  Some compilers also have options to initialise all
local variables with a bit pattern so that uninitialised stack variables will
cause program faults at run-time.  As with static memory allocations, there can
be problems with reading or writing past the end of stack variables, but as
their sizes are fixed these can usually easily be located.

@node Dynamic memory allocations, , Stack memory allocations, Memory allocations
@section Dynamic memory allocations
@cindex dynamic memory allocations
@cindex memory allocations, dynamic

The last type of memory allocation is known as a @emph{dynamic memory
allocation}, which corresponds to memory allocated via @code{malloc()} or
@code{operator new[]}.  The sizes, addresses and contents of such memory vary
at run-time and so can cause a lot of problems when trying to diagnose a fault
in a program.  These memory allocations are called dynamic memory allocations
because their location and size can vary throughout the lifetime of a program.

@cindex heap
@cindex garbage collector
@cindex ML
Such memory allocations are placed in a system memory area called the
@emph{heap}, which is allocated per process on some systems, but on others may
be allocated directly from the system in scattered blocks.  Unlike memory
allocated on the stack, memory allocated on the heap is not freed when a
function or scope is exited and so must be explicitly freed by the programmer.
The pattern of allocations and deallocations is not guaranteed to be (and is not
really expected to be) linear and so the functions that allocate memory from the
heap must be able to efficiently reuse freed memory and resize existing
allocated memory on request.  In some programming languages there is support for
a @emph{garbage collector}, which attempts to automatically free memory that has
had all references to it removed, but this has traditionally not been very
popular for programming languages such as C and C++, and has been more widely
used in functional languages like ML@footnote{There is currently at least one
garbage collection package available for C and C++ (@pxref{Related software}).}.

Because dynamic memory allocations are performed at run-time rather than
compile-time, they are outwith the domain of the compiler and must be
implemented in a run-time package, usually as a set of functions within a
linker library.  Such a package manages the heap in such a way as to abstract
its underlying structure from the programmer, providing a common interface to
heap management on different systems.  However, this @emph{malloc library} must
decide whether to implement a fast memory allocator, a space-conserving memory
allocator, or a bit of both.  It must also try to keep its own internal tables
to a minimum so as to conserve memory, but this means that it has very little
capability to diagnose errors if any occur.

@cindex alloca
@cindex variable length arrays
In some compiler implementations there is a builtin function called
@code{alloca()}.  This is a dynamic memory allocation function that allocates
memory from the stack rather than the heap, and so the memory is automatically
freed when the function that called it returns.  This is a non-standard feature
that is not guaranteed to be present in a compiler, and indeed may not be
possible to implement on some systems.  However, some compilers now support
variable length arrays which provide roughly the same functionality.

As can be seen from the above paragraphs, dynamic memory allocations are the
types of memory allocations that can cause the most problems in a program since
almost nothing about them can be used by the compiler to give the programmer
useful warnings about using uninitialised variables, using freed memory, running
off the end of a dynamically-allocated array, etc.  It is these types of memory
allocation problems that the mpatrol library loves to get its teeth into!

@chapter Operating system support
@cindex operating systems

@cindex memory management interface
@cindex embedded systems
@cindex systems, embedded
Beneath every malloc library's public interface there is the underlying
operating system's memory management interface.  This provides features which
can be as simple as giving processes the ability to allocate a new block of
memory for themselves, or it can offer advanced features such as protecting
areas of memory from being read or written.  Some embedded systems have no
operating systems and hence no support for dynamic memory allocation, and so the
malloc library must instead allocate blocks of memory from a fixed-sized array.
The mpatrol library can be built to support all of the above types of system,
but the more features an operating system can provide it with, the more it can
do.

@cindex address space
On operating systems such as UNIX and Windows, all dynamic memory allocation
requests from a process are dealt with by using a feature called @emph{virtual
memory}.  This means that a process cannot perform illegal requests without
them being denied, which protects the other running processes and the operating
system from being affected by such errors.  However, on AmigaOS and Netware
platforms there is no virtual memory support and so all processes effectively
share the same address space as the operating system and any other running
processes.  This means that one process can accidentally write into the data
structures of another process, usually causing the other process to fail and
bring down the system.  In addition, a process which allocates a lot of memory
will result in there being less available memory for other running processes,
and in extreme cases the operating system itself.

@cindex physical memory
@cindex memory, physical
@emph{Virtual memory} is an operating system feature that was originally used to
provide large usable address spaces for every process on machines that had very
little physical memory.  It is used by an operating system to
fool@footnote{Well, perhaps that's too harsh a word, but it will certainly seem
that way to a process running on a 32-bit UNIX system with only 4 megabytes of
physical memory, and yet it will be able to read from and write to over 4
gigabytes of virtual memory!} a running process into believing that it can
allocate a vast amount of memory for its own purposes, although whether it is
allowed to or not depends on the operating system and the permissions of the
individual user.

@cindex memory management unit

@cindex page
Virtual memory works by translating a virtual address (which the process uses)
into a physical address (which the operating system uses).  It is generally
implemented via a piece of hardware called a @emph{memory management unit}, or
MMU.  The MMU's primary job is to translate any virtual addresses that are
referred to by machine instructions into physical addresses by looking up a
table which is built by the operating system.  This table contains mappings to
and from @emph{pages}@footnote{The size of a page varies between operating
systems and processor architectures, but they are generally around 4 or 8
kilobytes in size, and are always a power of two.} rather than bytes since it
would otherwise be very inefficient to handle mappings between individual bytes.
As a result, every virtual memory operation operates on pages, which are
indivisible and are always aligned to the system page size.

@cindex swapping
@cindex swap file
@cindex swap in
@cindex swap out
Even though each process can now see a huge address space, what happens when it
attempts to allocate more pages than actually physically exist, or allocate an
additional page of memory when all of the physical pages are in use by it and
other processes?  This problem is solved by the operating system temporarily
saving one or more of the least-used pages (which might not necessarily belong
that that process) to a special place in the file system called a @emph{swap
file}, and mapping the new pages to the physical addresses where the old pages
once resided.  The old pages which have been @emph{swapped out} are no longer
currently accessible, but their location in the swap file is noted in the
translation table.

@cindex page fault
@cindex fault, page
@cindex thrashing
However, if one of the pages that has been swapped out is accessed again, a
@emph{page fault} occurs at the instruction which referred to the address and
the operating system catches this and reloads the page from the swap file,
possibly having to swap out another page to make space for the new one.  If this
occurs too often then the operating system can slow down, having to constantly
swap in and swap out the same pages over and over again.  Such a problem is
called @emph{thrashing} and can only really be overcome by using less virtual
memory or buying more physical memory.

@cindex memory mapped files
@cindex mapping files
@cindex files, mapping
It is also possible to take advantage of the virtual memory system's
interaction between physical memory and the file system in program code, since
mapping an existing file to memory means that the usual file I/O operations can
be replaced with memory read and write operations.  The operating system will
work out the optimum way to read and write any buffers and it means that only
one copy of the file exists in both physical memory and the file system.  Note
that this is how @emph{shared libraries}@footnote{DLLs on Windows platforms.}
on UNIX platforms are generally implemented, with each individual process that
uses the shared library having it mapped to somewhere in its address space.

@cindex memory protection
@cindex read protection
@cindex write protection
Another major feature of virtual memory is its ability to read protect and write
protect individual pages of process memory.  This means that the operating
system can control access to different parts of the address space for each
process, and also means that a process can read and/or write protect an area of
memory when it wants to ensure that it won't ever read or write to it again.  If
an illegal memory access is detected then a @emph{signal} will be sent to the
process, which can either be caught and handled or will otherwise terminate the
process.  Note that as with all virtual memory operations, this ability to
protect memory only applies to pages, so that it is not possible to protect
individual bytes.

@cindex watch points
However, some versions of UNIX have programmable software @emph{watch points}
which are implemented at operating system level.  These are normally used by
debuggers to watch a specified area of memory that is expected to be read from
or written to, but can just as easily be used to implement memory protection at
byte level.  Unfortunately, as this feature is implemented in
software@footnote{The operating system is still considered software.} rather
than in hardware, watch points tend to be incredibly slow, mainly as a result of
the operating system having to check every instruction before it is executed.

@cindex misaligned memory accesses
There is also an additional problem when using watch points, which is due to
misaligned reads from memory.  These can occur with compiler-generated code or
with optimised library routines where memory read, move or write operations have
been optimised to work at word level rather than byte level.  For example, the
@code{memcpy()} function would normally be written to copy memory a byte at a
time, but on some systems this can be improved by copying a word at a time.
Unfortunately, care has to be taken when reading and writing such words as the
equivalent bytes may not be aligned on word boundaries.  Technically, reading
additional bytes before or after a memory allocation when they share the same
word is legal, but when using watch points such errors will be picked up.  The
mpatrol library replaces most of the memory operation functions provided by the
system libraries with safer versions, although they may not be as efficient.

An operating system with virtual memory is usually going to run ever so slightly
slower than an operating system without it@footnote{Due to the overhead of
having to translate every address and swap in and out pages --- although memory
mapped files will usually be more efficient than using normal file operations on
a system without virtual memory.}, but the advantages of virtual memory far
outweigh the disadvantages, especially when used for debugging purposes.

@cindex calling convention
@cindex application binary interface
@cindex ABI
As stated in the section on stack memory allocations (@pxref{Stack memory
allocations}), when a function is called, a copy of the caller's state
information (including local variables and registers) is saved on the stack so
that it can be restored when the called function returns.  On many operating
systems there is a @emph{calling convention}@footnote{Usually part of the
@emph{Application Binary Interface}, or ABI.} which defines the layout of such
stack entries so that code compiled in different languages and with different
compilers can be intermixed.  This usually specifies at which stack offsets the
stack pointer, program counter and local variables for the calling function can
be found, although on some processor architectures the function calling
conventions are specified by the hardware and so the operating system must use
these instead.

@cindex stack tracebacks
@cindex tracebacks
On systems that have consistent calling conventions, it is usually possible to
perform call stack @emph{tracebacks} from within the current function in order
to determine the stack of function calls that led to the current function.  This
is extremely useful for debugging purposes and is done by examining the current
stack frame to see if there is a pointer to the previous stack frame.  If there
is, then it can be followed to find out all of the state information about the
calling function.  This can be repeated until there are no more stack frames.
This is generally how this information is determined by debuggers when a call
stack traceback is requested.

@cindex program counter
@cindex return address
In addition to the pointer to the previous stack frame, the saved state
information also always contains the saved program counter register, which
contains either the address of the instruction that performed the function call,
or the address of the instruction at which to continue execution when the
called function returns@footnote{Also known as the @emph{return address}.}.
This information can be used to identify which function performed the call,
since the address of the instruction must lie between the start and end of one
of the functions in the process.

@cindex object files
@cindex executable files
However, in order to determine this symbolic information, it must be possible to
find out where the start and end addresses of all of the functions in the
process are.  This can usually only be read from object files, since they
contain the symbol tables that were used by the linker to generate the final
executable file for the program.  The object file's symbol tables normally
contain information about the start address, size, name and visibility of every
symbol that was defined, but this depends on the format of the object file and
if the symbol tables have been stripped from the final executable file.

@cindex debugging information
@cindex line number table
If the object file was created by a compiler then it may also contain debugging
information that was generated by the compiler for use with a debugger.  Such
information may include a mapping of code addresses to source
lines@footnote{Generally known as a line number table.}, and this information
can be used by the mpatrol library to provide more meaningful information in
call stack tracebacks.

@cindex dynamic linking
@cindex dynamic linker
@cindex shared libraries
@cindex dynamic link libraries
@cindex DLLs
On systems that support shared libraries, additional work must be done to
determine the symbolic information for all of the functions which have been
defined in them.  The symbols for functions that are defined in shared libraries
normally appear as undefined symbols in the executable file for the program and
so must be searched in the system in order to get the necessary information.  It
is usually necessary to liaise with the @emph{dynamic linker}@footnote{Which is
the part of the operating system that performs the run-time linking of shared
libraries.} on many systems.

@node Threads, , Call stacks and symbol tables, Operating system support
@section Threads
@cindex threads

@cindex message passing
@cindex shared memory
On systems with virtual memory, such as UNIX and Windows, user programs are run
as @emph{processes} which have their own address space and resources.  If a
process needs to create sub-processes to perform other tasks it must call
@code{fork()} or @code{spawn()} to create new processes, but these new processes
do not share the same address space or resources as the parent process.  If
processes need to share memory they must either use a message passing interface
or explicitly mark a range of memory as shareable.

@cindex parallel programming
@cindex multi-processor systems
Traditionally, this was not too much of a handicap as parallel processing was
an expensive luxury and could only be made use of by the kernel of such systems.
However, with the birth of fast processors and parallel programming, programs
could be made to run more efficiently and faster on multi-processor systems by
having more than one @emph{thread} of control.  This was achieved by allowing
processes to have more than one program counter through which the processor
could execute instructions, and if one thread of control stalled for a
particular reason then another could continue without stalling the entire
process.

Such multithreaded programs allow parallel programming and implicit shared
memory between threads since all threads in a process share the same address
space and resources.  This is similar to operating systems that have no
virtual memory, such as AmigaOS and Netware@footnote{Where the kernel is
effectively a single process running all user programs as threads.}, except
that once a process terminates, all threads terminate as well and all of its
resources are still reclaimed.

@cindex threads library
@cindex POSIX threads
Multithreaded programming generally needs no compiler support, but does require
some primitive operations to be supported by the operating system for a threads
library to call.  The functions that are available in the threads library
provide the means for a process to create and destroy threads.  There are
currently several popular threads libraries available, although the POSIX
threads standard remains the definitive implementation.

@cindex semaphores
@cindex mutexes
@cindex re-entrancy
It is always important to remember when programming a multithreaded application
that because all threads in a process share the same address space, measures
must be taken to prevent threads reading and writing global data in a haphazard
fashion.  This can either be done by locking with semaphores and mutexes, or can
be performed by using stack variables instead of global variables since every
thread has its own local stack.  Care must be taken to write re-entrant
functions --- i.e. a function will give exactly the same result with one thread
as it will with multiple threads running it at the same time.

@section Library behaviour
@cindex library behaviour

Most of the behaviour of the mpatrol library can be controlled at run-time via
options which are read from the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable.
This prevents you having to recompile or relink each time you want to change a
library setting, and so makes it really easy to try out different settings to
locate a particular bug.  You should know how to set the value of an environment
variable on your system before you read on.

@cindex alignment
@cindex misaligned data
@cindex bus errors
By default, the mpatrol library will attempt to determine the minimum required
alignment for any generic memory allocation when it first initialises itself.
This may be affected by the compiler and its settings when the library was built
but it should normally reflect the minimum alignment required by the processor
on your system.  If you would prefer a larger (or perhaps even smaller) default
alignment you may change it at run-time using the @option{DEFALIGN} option.  The
value you supply must be in bytes, must be a power of two, and should not be
larger that the system page size.  If you encounter bus errors due to misaligned
memory accesses then you should increase this value.

On systems that have virtual memory the library will attempt to write-protect
all of its internal structures when user code is being run.  This ensures that
it is nearly impossible for a program to corrupt any mpatrol library data.
However, unprotecting and then protecting the structures at every library call
has a slight overhead so you may prefer to disable this behaviour by using the
@option{NOPROTECT} option.  This has no effect on systems that have no virtual
memory.

Usually it is desirable for many system library routines to be protected from
being interrupted by certain signals since they may themselves be called from
signal handlers.  If this is not the case then it may be possible to interrupt
the program from within such routines, perhaps causing problems if their global
variables are left in an undefined state.  As the mpatrol library replaces some
of these system library routines it is also possible to specify that they are
protected from certain interrupt signals using the @option{SAFESIGNALS} option.
However, this can sometimes result in it being hard to interrupt the program
from the keyboard if a lot of processor time is spent in mpatrol routines,
which is why this behaviour is disabled by default@footnote{In mpatrol release
1.0 it was enabled by default.}.

@cindex sbrk
@cindex mmap
On UNIX systems, the usual way for malloc libraries to allocate memory from the
process heap is through the @code{sbrk()} system call.  This allocates memory
from a contiguous heap, but has the disadvantage in that other library functions
may also allocate memory using the same function, thus creating holes in the
heap.  This is not a problem for mpatrol, but you may have a suspicion that your
bug is due to a function from another library corrupting your data so you may
wish to use the @option{USEMMAP} option.  This is only available on systems that
have the @code{mmap()} system call and allows mpatrol to allocate all of its
memory from a part of the process heap that is non-contiguous (i.e. each call to
@code{mmap()} may return a block of memory that is completely unrelated to that
returned by the previous call).

By default, every time an mpatrol library function is called the library will
automatically check the freed memory and overflow buffers of every memory
allocation, which can slow program execution down, especially if you suspect the
error you are looking for occurs at the 1000th memory allocation, for example.
You can therefore use the @option{CHECK} option to specify a range of memory
allocations at which the mpatrol library will automatically check the freed
memory and overflow buffers.  All other allocations that fall outside this range
will not be checked.

@cindex stripped executable file
If the mpatrol library that was built for your system supports reading symbolic
information from a program's executable file, but it cannot locate the
executable file, or you wish to specify an alternative, you can use the
@option{PROGFILE} option to do this.  All this does is instruct the mpatrol
library to read symbols from this file instead.  Note that on systems that
support dynamic linking, the library can also read symbols from a dynamically
linked executable file that has had its normal symbol table stripped.

Finally, a list of all of the recognised options in the mpatrol library can be
displayed to the standard error file stream by using the @option{HELP} option.
This will not affect the settings of the library in any way, so you should be
able to use other options at the same time.

@node Logging and tracing, General errors, Library behaviour, Using mpatrol
@section Logging and tracing
@cindex logging
@cindex tracing

If you would like to see a complete log of all of the memory allocations,
reallocations and deallocations performed by your program, use the
@option{LOGALL} option.  This provides detailed tracing for each of the mpatrol
library functions, and a full description of the format of such tracing is given
in Example 1 (@pxref{Example 1}).  Alternatively, you may select one or more
types of functions to be traced using the @option{LOGALLOCS},
@option{LOGREALLOCS}, @option{LOGFREES} and @option{LOGMEMORY} options if you
feel that the log file is too large when @option{LOGALL} is used.  By default
all diagnostics from the mpatrol library get sent to @file{mpatrol.log} in the
current directory, but this can be changed using the @option{LOGFILE} option.

On systems that support it, every log entry also contains a call stack
traceback that may also include the names of the symbols that appear on the
call stack.  If the object file access library that mpatrol was built with has
support for reading line number tables from object files then the
@option{USEDEBUG} option will also try to determine the file name and line
number for each entry in the call stack, but only if the object files contain
the relevant debugging information.  This information will only be available
before program termination and so any call stack tracebacks that appear after
the library summary will not be displayed with their corresponding file name
and line number.  This option will also slow down program execution since a
search through the line number tables will have to be made every time a call
stack is displayed.

@cindex library settings
@cindex settings
@cindex library statistics
@cindex statistics
The mpatrol library will always try to display as much useful information as
possible in this log file, and will always display a summary of library settings
and statistics when your program terminates successfully.  If you don't get this
then your program did not call @code{exit()} and either called @code{abort()} or
was terminated by the operating system instead.  In such cases, either use a
debugger to see where your program crashed or use the @option{LOGALL} option to
see the last successful library call in the log file so that you have a rough
idea of where your program crashed.

@cindex memory map
@cindex map of memory
@cindex symbol summary
It is also possible to get mpatrol to write more summary information to the log
file after it writes out its settings and statistics at program termination.
Use the @option{SHOWFREED} and @option{SHOWUNFREED} options to display a list of
freed and unfreed memory allocations.  The former will only be displayed if the
@option{NOFREE} option is used, but the latter can be useful for detecting
memory leaks.  The @option{SHOWMAP} option will display a memory map of the heap
that was valid when the process terminated, and the @option{SHOWSYMBOLS} option
will display any symbolic information that the mpatrol library managed to obtain
from any executable files and libraries that were relevant to the program being
tested.  All of these options can be selected with the @option{SHOWALL} option.

@node General errors, Overwrites and underwrites, Logging and tracing, Using mpatrol
@section General errors
@cindex general errors

By default, the mpatrol library follows the guidelines for ANSI C regarding the
behaviour of the dynamic memory allocation functions it replaces@footnote{I
attempted to do the same for ANSI C++ but there are still namespace and
exception handling issues to be resolved.}.  This means that calling
@code{malloc()} with a size of zero is allowed, for example.  However, warnings
can be generated for all of these types of calls by using the @option{CHECKALL}
option.  The @option{CHECKALLOCS} option warns only about calls to
@code{malloc()} and similar functions with a size of zero, the
@option{CHECKREALLOCS} option warns only about calls to @code{realloc()} and
similar functions with either a null pointer or a size of zero, and the
@option{CHECKFREES} option warns only about calls to @code{free()} and similar
functions with a null pointer.

@cindex allocation byte
@cindex free byte
All newly-allocated memory can be pre-filled with a specified byte by using the
@option{ALLOCBYTE} option.  This can be used to catch out code that expects
newly-allocated memory to be zeroed, although this option will have no effect on
memory that was allocated with @code{calloc()}.  All free memory can also be
pre-filled with a different specified byte by using the @option{FREEBYTE}
option.  This will catch out code that expects to be able to use the contents of
freed memory.

@cindex prevent freeing memory
@cindex free memory
@cindex freed memory
Alternatively, the mpatrol library can be instructed to keep all freed memory
allocations so that its diagnostics can be clearer about which freed allocation
a piece of code is erroneously trying to access.  This is controlled with the
@option{NOFREE} option, but since it never reuses any freed allocations it can
result in a lot more heap memory being used.  Note that this option
distinguishes between @emph{free} memory and @emph{freed} memory.  @emph{Free}
memory is unallocated memory that has been taken from the system heap.
@emph{Freed} memory is a freed memory allocation, with all of the original
details of the allocation preserved.

@cindex preserve freed contents
Normally, the @option{NOFREE} option will fill the freed allocation with the
free byte so that any code that accesses it will hopefully fall over.  However,
the original contents can be preserved using the @option{PRESERVE} option in
case you need to see what the contents were just before it was freed.  The
@option{NOFREE} option is also affected by the @option{PAGEALLOC} option, since
then the freed allocation will have its contents both read and write protected
so that nothing can access them.  If the @option{PRESERVE} option is used in
this case then the freed allocation will only be made write-protected so that
the original contents can be read from but not written to.

@node Overwrites and underwrites, Using with a debugger, General errors, Using mpatrol
@section Overwrites and underwrites
@cindex overwrites
@cindex underwrites

Once a block of memory has been allocated, it is imperative that the program
does not attempt to write any data past the end of the block or write any data
just before the beginning of the block.  Even writing a single byte just beyond
the end of an allocation or just before the beginning of an allocation can cause
havoc.  This is because most malloc libraries store the details of the allocated
block in the first few words before the beginning of the block, such as its size
and a pointer to the next block.  The mpatrol library does not do this, so a
program which failed using the normal malloc library and worked when the mpatrol
library was linked in is a possible candidate for turning on overflow buffers.

Such memory corruption can be extremely difficult to pinpoint as it is unlikely
to show itself until the next call is made to the malloc library, or if the
internal malloc library blocks were not overwritten, the next time the data is
read from the block that was overwritten.  If the former is the case then the
next library call will cause an internal error or a crash, but only when the
memory block that was affected is referenced.  This is likely to disappear when
using the mpatrol library since it keeps its internal structures separate, and
write-protects them on systems that support memory protection.

@cindex overflow buffers
@cindex buffers, overflow
@cindex fence posts
@cindex overflow size
@cindex overflow byte
In order to identify such errors, it is possible to place special
buffers@footnote{Commonly known as @emph{overflow buffers} or @emph{fence
posts}.} on either side of every memory allocation, and these will be pre-filled
with a specified byte.  Before every mpatrol library call, the library will
check the integrity of every such overflow buffer in order to check for a memory
underwrite or overwrite.  Depending on the number of allocations and size of
these buffers, this can take a noticable amount of time (which is why overflow
buffers are disabled by default), but can mean that these errors get noticed
sooner.  The option which governs this is @option{OFLOWSIZE}.  The byte with
which they get pre-filled can be changed with @option{OFLOWBYTE}.  Depending on
what gets written, it might only be possible to see such errors when a different
size of buffer or a different pre-fill byte is used.

A worse situation can occur when it is only reads from memory that overflow or
underflow; i.e. with the faulty code reading just before or just past a memory
allocation.  These cannot be detected by overflow buffers as it is not possible
using conventional means to interrupt every single read from memory.  However,
on systems with virtual memory, it is possible to use the memory protection
feature to provide an alternative to overflow buffers, although at the added
expense of increased memory usage.

The @option{PAGEALLOC} option turns on this feature and automatically rounds
up the size of every memory allocation to a multiple of the system page size.
It also rounds up the size of every overflow buffer to a multiple of the system
page size so that every memory allocation occupies its own set of pages of
virtual memory and no two memory allocations occupy the same page of virtual
memory.  The overflow buffers are then read and write protected so that any
memory accesses to them will generate an error@footnote{This is a feature that
was first used by Electric Fence (@pxref{Related software}) to track down memory
corruption.}.  Following on from the previous section, the @option{PAGEALLOC}
option also causes free memory to be read and write protected as well since that
will also occupy non-overlapping virtual memory pages.

The remaining memory that is left over within an allocation's pages is
effectively turned into traditional overflow buffers, being pre-filled with the
overflow byte and checked periodically by the mpatrol library to ensure that
nothing has written into them.  However, because of this remaining memory, the
library has a choice of where to place the memory allocation within its pages.
If it places the allocation at the very beginning then it will catch memory
underwrites, but if it places the allocation at the very end then it will catch
memory overwrites.  Such a choice can be controlled at run-time by supplying an
argument to the @option{PAGEALLOC} option.  If @option{PAGEALLOC=LOWER} is used
then every allocation will be placed at the very beginning of its pages and if
@option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} is used then the placement will be at the very end of
its pages.  This is probably better explained in Example 3 (@pxref{Example 3})
where the problems with @option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} and alignment are also
discussed.

Obviously, there are still some deficiencies when using @option{PAGEALLOC} since
it can use up a huge amount of memory (especially with @option{NOFREE}) and the
overflow buffers within an allocation's pages can still be read without causing
an immediate error.  Both of these deficiencies can be overcome by using the
@option{OFLOWWATCH} option to install @emph{software watch points} instead of
overflow buffers, but there are still very few systems that support software
watch points at the moment, and it can slow a program's execution speed down by
a factor of around 10,000.  The reason for this is that software watch points
instruct the operating system to check every read from and write to memory,
which means that it has to single-step through a process checking every
instruction before it is executed.  However, this is a very thorough way of
checking for overflows and is unlikely to miss anything, although there may be
problems with misaligned memory accesses when using watch points
(@pxref{Virtual memory}).

Note that from release 1.1.0 of mpatrol, the library comes with replacement
functions for many memory operation functions, such as @code{memset()} and
@code{memcpy()}.  These new functions provide additional checks to ensure that
if a memory operation is being performed on a memory block, the operation will
not read or write before or beyond the boundaries of that block.

Normally, if an error is discovered in the call to such functions, the mpatrol
library will report the error but prevent the operation from being performed
before continuing execution.  If the error was that the range of memory being
operated on overflowed the boundaries of an existing memory allocation then the
@option{ALLOWOFLOW} option can be used to turn the error into a warning and
force the operation to continue.  This behaviour can be desirable in certain
cases where third-party libraries are being used that make such calls but the
end result does not overflow the allocation boundary.

To conclude, if you suspect your program has a piece of code which is performing
illegal memory underwrites or overwrites to a memory allocation you should use
each of the following options in sequence, but only if your system supports
them.

@section Using with a debugger
@cindex using with a debugger
@cindex debugger
@cindex debugging

@cindex halting the library
@cindex gdb
@cindex breakpoint
If you would like to use mpatrol to pause at a specific memory allocation,
reallocation or deallocation in a debugger then this section will describe how
to go about it.  Unfortunately, debuggers vary widely in function and usage and
are normally very system-dependent.  The example below will use @command{gdb} as
the debugger, but as long as you know how to set a breakpoint within a debugger,
any one will do.

First of all, decide where you would like the mpatrol library to pause when
running your program within the debugger.  You can choose one allocation index
to break at using the @option{ALLOCSTOP} option, or you can choose to break at
a specific reallocation of that allocation by also using the
@option{REALLOCSTOP} option.  If you use @option{REALLOCSTOP} without using
@option{ALLOCSTOP} then you will break at the first memory allocation that has
been reallocated the specified number of times.  You can also choose to break at
the point in your program that frees a specific allocation index by using the
@option{FREESTOP} option.

The normal process for determining where you would like to pause your program
in the debugger is by using the @option{LOGALL} option and examining the log
file produced by mpatrol.  If your program crashed then you should look at the
last entry in the log file to see what the allocation index (and possibly also
the reallocation index) of the last successful call was.  You can then decide
which of the above options to use.  Note that the debugger will break at a point
before any work is done by the mpatrol library for that allocation index so that
you can see if it was the last successful operation that caused the damage.

Having decided which combination of mpatrol options to use, you should set them
in the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable before running the debugger on
your program.  Alternatively, your debugger may have a command that allows you
to modify your environment during debugging, but you're just as well setting the
environment variable before you run the debugger as it shouldn't make any
difference@footnote{Unless you've linked the debugger with the mpatrol
library.}.

After you get to the debugger command prompt, you should set a breakpoint at the
@code{__mp_trap()} function.  This is the function that gets called when the
specified allocation index and/or reallocation index appears and so when you
run your program under the debugger the mpatrol library will call
@code{__mp_trap()} and the debugger will stop at that point.  If you are not
running your program within a debugger, or if you haven't set the breakpoint,
then @code{__mp_trap()} will still be called, but it won't do anything.  Note
that there may be some naming issues on some platforms where the visible name of
a global function gets an underscore prepended to it.  You may have to take that
into account when setting the breakpoint on such systems.

@cindex single-step
Now that you have set the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable and have
set the debugger to break at @code{__mp_trap()}, all that is required is for you
to run your program.  Hopefully, the debugger should stop at @code{__mp_trap()}.
If it doesn't then you may have to check your environment variable settings to
ensure that they are the same as when you ran the program outwith the debugger,
although obviously with the addition of @option{ALLOCSTOP}, etc.  Once the
program has been halted by the debugger, you can then single-step through your
code until you see where it goes wrong.  If this is near the end of your program
then you'll have saved yourself a lot of time by using this method.

The following example will be used to illustrate the steps involved in using the
@option{ALLOCSTOP}, @option{REALLOCSTOP} and @option{FREESTOP} options.
However, it is only for tutorial purposes and the same effect could easily be
achieved by breaking at line 18 in a debugger because in this case it is obvious
from the code and the mpatrol log file where it is going wrong.  In real
programs this is hardly ever the case@footnote{The other reason that this
program is simple is because a proper example would generally involve crashing
the program, but on AmigaOS and Netware that would also involve crashing the
system --- not something you'd want to do whilst trying this out.}.

In this example, we'll want to use @option{ALLOCSTOP} to halt the program at
the 1000th memory allocation so that we can step through it with a debugger.
So, set @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} to @option{ALLOCSTOP=1000} and load the program
into the debugger.  If you are using @command{gdb} you can now do the following
steps, but if you are not you will have to use the equivalent commands in your
debugger.  Note that @samp{(gdb)} is the debugger command prompt and so anything
that appears on that line after that should be typed as a command.

@end smallexample

After setting the breakpoint and running the program, the debugger halts at
@code{__mp_trap()}.  Because @code{__mp_trap()} is a function within the mpatrol
library, you don't want to bother stepping through any of the library functions,
and in this case you can't since the mpatrol library was not compiled with
debugging information enabled.  So, after returning from all of the library
functions, the source line becomes line 16 because that was the location of the
1000th memory allocation.  Single-stepping twice gets us to line 18 which is our
destination.

Sometimes it is useful to be able to see information about a memory allocation
whilst running a program from within a debugger.  The @code{__mp_printinfo()}
function is provided for that purpose and takes a heap address as its only
argument.  Using the above example, it would have been possible to print out
information about the pointer @samp{p} at line 17 from within @command{gdb}:

@smallexample
(gdb) call __mp_printinfo(p)
address 0x80033000 located in allocated block:
    start of block:     0x80033000

        0x80000D24 _start
@end smallexample

@cindex .gdbinit
Some debuggers, such as @command{gdb}, also allow you to define your own
commands for use in a debugging session.  The following example defines a
new @command{gdb} command called @samp{printalloc} which calls
@code{__mp_printinfo()}@footnote{A sample GDB command file for use with
mpatrol can be found in @file{extra/.gdbinit}.}:

@smallexample

@node Testing, Library functions, Using with a debugger, Using mpatrol
@section Testing
@cindex testing

The mpatrol library has several features that make it useful when testing a
program's dynamic memory allocations.  These are features that do not help in
fixing an existing bug, but rather help to identify additional bugs that may be
lurking in your code.

@cindex limiting available memory
It is possible to set a simulated upper limit on the amount of heap memory
available to a process with the @option{LIMIT} option, which accepts a size in
bytes, but will be disabled when it is zero.  This can be extremely useful for
testing a program under simulated low memory conditions to see how it handles
such errors.  Of course, you should set the heap limit to a value less than the
amount of actual available memory otherwise this option will have no effect.
Note that the mpatrol library may use up a small amount of heap memory when it
initialises itself@footnote{Actually, it's not really the mpatrol library that
uses the memory but the object file access libraries since they call
@code{malloc()} to allocate any memory that they require.} so the value passed
to the @option{LIMIT} option may need to be set slightly higher than you would
normally expect.

@cindex random failures
@cindex failure frequency
@cindex failure seed
It is also possible to instruct the mpatrol library to randomly fail a certain
number of memory allocations so that you can further test error handling code in
a program.  The frequency at which failures occur can be controlled with the
@option{FAILFREQ} option, where a value of zero means that no failures will
occur, but any other value will randomly cause failures.  For example, a value
of @samp{10} will cause roughly one in ten failures and a value of @samp{1} will
cause every memory allocation to fail.  The random sequence can be made
predictable by using the @option{FAILSEED} option.  If this is non-zero then the
same program run with the same failure frequency and same failure seed will fail
on exactly the same memory allocations.  If this is zero then the failure seed
will itself be set randomly, but you can see its value when the summary is
displayed at program termination.

@cindex batch testing
When running @emph{batch tests}@footnote{A set of tests that run without user
intervention.} it is sometimes useful to be able to detect if there have been
any memory leaks.  Such leaks should normally be distinguished from code which
has purposely not freed the memory that it allocated, so there may be a certain
expected number of unfreed allocations at program termination.  It may be that
you would like to highlight any additional unfreed allocations since they may be
due to real memory leaks, so the @option{UNFREEDABORT} option can be set to a
threshold number of expected unfreed allocations.  If the library detects a
number of unfreed allocations higher than this then it will abort the program at
termination so that it fails.  All tests that fail in this way can then be
examined after the test suite finishes.

@node Library functions, Utilities, Testing, Using mpatrol
@section Library functions
@cindex library functions

Along with the standard set of C and C++ dynamic memory allocation functions,
the mpatrol library also comes with an additional set of functions which can be
used to provide additional information to your program, and which can be called
at various points in your code for debugging purposes.  You must always include
the @file{mpatrol.h} header file in order to use these functions, but you can
check for a specific version of the mpatrol library by checking the
@code{MPATROL_VERSION} preprocessor macro.

It is possible to obtain a great deal of information about an existing memory
allocation using the @code{__mp_info()} function.  This takes an address as an

As you can see, anything that the mpatrol library knows about any memory
allocation can be obtained for use in your own code, which can be very useful
if you need to write handlers to keep track of memory allocations, etc. for
debugging purposes.  It can also be useful to have this information when running
your program within a debugger, so you can use the @code{__mp_printinfo()}
function to display information about a heap address if your debugger supports
calling functions from the command prompt.

It is also possible for you to be able to intercept calls to allocate,
reallocate and deallocate memory for your own purposes.  You can install
prologue and epilogue functions that the mpatrol library will call before and
after every time one of its functions is called.  These can be used for
additional tracing or simply to add extra checks to your code.  The following
code is an example of this and can be found in @file{tests/pass/test2.c}.

Once again, if you compile and run the above code, you should see the following
output.

@smallexample

@end smallexample

Along with being able to install prologue and epilogue functions, you can also
install a low-memory handler with the @code{__mp_nomemory()} function, which
will be called by the mpatrol library if it ever runs out of memory during the
call to a memory allocation function.  This gives you the opportunity to use
that handler to either free up any unneeded memory or simply to abort, thus
removing the need to check for failed allocations.

Finally, there are three functions which affect the mpatrol library globally.
The first, @code{__mp_check()}, allows you to force an internal check of the
mpatrol library's data structures at any point during program execution.  The
other two functions, @code{__mp_memorymap()} and @code{__mp_summary()} allow you
to force the generation of a memory map or library statistics at any point in
your program, in much the same way as they would normally be displayed at the
end of program execution.

@node Utilities, , Library functions, Using mpatrol
@section Utilities
@cindex utilities

A command is provided with the mpatrol distribution which can run programs that
have been linked with the mpatrol library, using a combination of mpatrol
options that can be set via the command line.  All of these options but one map
directly onto their equivalent environment variable settings and exist mainly
so that the user does not have to manually change the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable.

@cindex LD_PRELOAD
@cindex _RLD_LIST
The one option that is the exception to this is the @option{-d} option, which
can be used to run a program under the control of the mpatrol library, even if
it wasn't originally linked with the mpatrol library.  This can only be done on
systems that support dynamic linking and where the dynamic linker recognises the
@env{LD_PRELOAD} or @env{_RLD_LIST} environment variables.  Even then, it can
only be used when the program that is being run has been dynamically linked with
the system C library, rather than statically linked.

The reason for all of these limitations is that some SVR4 UNIX platforms have a
special feature in the dynamic linker which can be told to override the symbols
from one shared library using the symbols from another shared library at
run-time.  In this case, it involves replacing the symbols for @code{malloc()},
etc., in the system C library with the mpatrol versions, but only if they were
marked as undefined in the original executable file and would therefore have to
have been loaded from @file{libc.so}.

However, if a program qualifies for use with the @option{-d} option, it means
that you can trace all of its dynamic memory allocations as well as running it
with any of the mpatrol library's debugging options.  This is mainly a
@emph{toy} feature which allows you to view and manipulate the dynamic memory
allocations of programs that you don't have the source for, but in theory it
could be quite useful if you need to debug a previously released executable and
are unable to recompile or relink it.

Note that the @command{mpatrol} command must be set up to use the correct
object file format access libraries that are required for your system if you
wish to use the @option{-d} option.  If the mpatrol library was built with
@code{FORMAT=FORMAT_ELF32} support then it must be told to preload the ELF
access library (normally @file{libelf.so}).  If it was built with
@code{FORMAT=FORMAT_BFD} support then it must be told to preload the GNU BFD
access libraries (normally @file{libbfd.so} and @file{libiberty.so}).  However,
if these libraries only exist on your system in archive form then you must build
@file{libmpatrol.so} with these extra libraries incorporated into it so that
there are no dependencies on them at run-time.  However, there may well be
problems if the resulting shared library contains position-dependent code from
the archive libraries you incorporated.  The only way to find out is for you to
try it and see.

@cindex embedded libraries
In order to build a shared version of the mpatrol library with embedded object
file format access libraries, you must first modify the @file{Makefile} you
would normally use to build the mpatrol library.  At the lines where the linker
is invoked to build the shared library, you must explicitly add any object file
format access libraries that you want to use at the end of the linker command
line.  This ensures that all references to such libraries will be resolved at
link time rather than run time.  You must then edit the file @file{src/config.h}
and remove all of the libraries that you embedded from the definition of the
@code{MP_PRELOAD_LIBS} preprocessor macro.  Finally, rebuild the shared version
of the mpatrol library and the @command{mpatrol} command and see if your efforts
were worth it.

@cindex mleak
Another utility program that is provided is called @command{mleak} and is
useful for detecting memory leaks in log files produced by the mpatrol library.
This program should be used if the mpatrol library could not finish writing the
log file due to abnormal program termination (which would prevent the
@option{SHOWUNFREED} option from working), but note that some of the unfreed
allocations might have been freed if the program had terminated successfully.

The @command{mleak} command scans through an mpatrol log file looking for
lines beginning with @samp{ALLOC:} and @samp{FREE:} but ignores lines beginning
with @samp{REALLOC:}, so only the @option{LOGALLOCS} and @option{LOGFREES}
options are necessary when running a program linked with the mpatrol library.
Note that as a result of this, no attempt is made to account for resizing of
memory allocations and so the total amount of memory used by the resulting
unfreed allocations may not be entirely accurate.

The @command{mleak} command takes one optional argument which must be a valid
mpatrol log filename but if it is omitted then it will use @file{mpatrol.log} as
the name of the log file to use.  The @command{mleak} command makes two passes
over the log file so the file must be randomly-accessible.  If the filename
argument is given as @samp{-} then the standard input file stream will be used
as the log file.

@node Profiling, Improving performance, Using mpatrol, Top
@chapter Profiling
@cindex profiling
@cindex memory allocation profiling

The mpatrol library has the capability to summarise the information it
accumulated about the behaviour of dynamic memory allocations and deallocations
over the lifetime of any program that it was linked and run with.  This summary
shows a rough profile of all memory allocations that were made, and is hence
called @emph{profiling}.  There are several other different kinds of profiling
provided with most compilation tools, but they generally profile function calls
or line numbers in combination with the time it takes to execute them.

Memory allocation profiling is useful since it allows a programmer to see which
functions directly allocate memory from the heap, with a view to optimising the
memory usage or performance of a program.  It also summarises any unfreed memory
allocations that were present at the end of program execution, some of which
could be as a result of memory leaks.  In addition, a summary of the sizes and
distribution of all memory allocations and deallocations is available.

Only allocations and deallocations are recorded, with each reallocation being
treated as a deallocation immediately followed by an allocation.  For full
memory allocation profiling support, call stack traversal must be supported in
the mpatrol library and all of the program's symbols must have been successfully
read by the mpatrol library before the program was run.  The library will
attempt to compensate if either of these requirements are not met, but the
displayed tables may contain less meaningful information.

Memory allocation profiling is disabled by default, but can be enabled using
the @option{PROF} option.  This writes all of the profiling data to a file
called @file{mpatrol.out} in the current directory at the end of program
execution, but the name of this file can be changed using the @option{PROFFILE}
option.  Sometimes it can also be desirable for the mpatrol library to write out
the accumulated profiling information in the middle of program execution rather
than just at the end, even if it is only partially complete, and this behaviour
can be controlled with the @option{AUTOSAVE} option.  This can be particularly
useful when running the program from within a debugger, when it is necessary to
analyse the profiling information at a certain point during program execution.

@cindex allocation boundaries
When profiling memory allocations, it is necessary to distinguish between small,
medium, large and extra large memory allocations that were made by a function.
The boundaries which distinguish between these allocation sizes can be
controlled via the @option{SMALLBOUND}, @option{MEDIUMBOUND} and
@option{LARGEBOUND} options, but they default to 32, 256 and 2048 bytes
respectively, which should suffice for most circumstances.

@cindex mprof
The @command{mprof} command is a tool designed to read a profiling output file
produced by the mpatrol library and display the profiling information that was
obtained.  The profiling information includes summaries of all of the memory
allocations listed by size and the function that allocated them and a list of
memory leaks with the call stack of the allocating function.

Along with the options listed below, the @command{mprof} command takes one
optional argument which must be a valid mpatrol profiling output filename but
if it is omitted then it will use @file{mpatrol.out} as the name of the file to
use.  If the filename argument is given as @samp{-} then the standard input
file stream will be used as the profiling output file.

@table @asis
@item @option{-a}
Specifies that different call sites from within the same function are to be
differentiated and that the names of all functions should be displayed with
their call site offset in bytes.  This affects the direct allocation and memory
leak tables.

@item @option{-c}
Specifies that certain tables should be sorted by the number of allocations or
deallocations rather than the total number of bytes allocated or deallocated.
This affects the direct allocation and memory leak tables.

@item @option{-n} <@var{depth}>
Specifies the maximum stack depth to use when calculating if one call site has
the same call stack as another call site.  This also specifies the maximum
number of functions to display in a call stack.  If @var{depth} is @samp{0} then
the call stack depth will be unlimited in size.  The default call stack depth
is @samp{1}.  This affects the memory leak table.

@item @option{-V}
Displays the version number of the @command{mprof} command.
@end table

We'll now look at an example of using the mpatrol library to profile the dynamic
memory allocations in a program.  However, remember that this example will only
fully work on your machine if the mpatrol library supports call stack traversal
and reading symbols from executable files on that platform.  If that is not the
case then only some of the features will be available.

The following example program performs some simple calculations and displays a
list of numbers on its standard output file stream, but it serves to illustrate
all of the different features of memory allocation profiling that mpatrol is
capable of.  The source for the program can be found in
@file{tests/profile/test1.c}.

After the above program has been compiled and linked with the mpatrol library,
it should be run with the @option{PROF} option set in the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable.  Note that @file{mpatrol.h} was not included as it is not
necessary for profiling purposes.

@cindex binary file
If all went well, a list of numbers should be displayed on the screen and a file
called @file{mpatrol.out} should have been produced in the current directory.
This is a binary file containing the total amount of profiling information that
the mpatrol library gathered while the program was running, but it contains
concise numerical data rather than human-readable data.  To make use of this
file, the @command{mprof} command must be run.  An excerpt from the output

@cindex allocation bin table
@cindex allocation bins
@cindex bin
The first table shown is the allocation bin table which summarises the sizes of
all objects that were dynamically allocated throughout the lifetime of the
program.  In this particular case, counts of all allocations and deallocations
of sizes 1 to 1023 bytes were recorded by the mpatrol library in their own
specific @emph{bin} and this information was written to the profiling output
file.  Allocations and deallocations of sizes larger than or equal to 1024 bytes
are counted as well and the total number of bytes that they represent are also
recorded.  This information can be extremely useful in understanding which sizes
of data structures are allocated most during program execution, and where
changes might be made to make more efficient use of the dynamically allocated
memory.

As can be seen from the allocation bin table, 8 allocations of 2 bytes, 99
allocations of 3 bytes, 118 allocations of 4 bytes, 31 allocations of 5 bytes
and 256 allocations of 8 bytes were made during the execution of the program.
However, all of these memory allocations except the 8 byte allocations were
still not freed by the time the program terminated, resulting in a total memory
leak of 940 bytes.

@cindex direct allocation table
@cindex direct allocations
The next table shown is the direct allocation table which lists all of the
functions that allocated memory and how much memory they allocated.  The
@samp{s m l x} columns represent @emph{small}, @emph{medium}, @emph{large} and
@emph{extra large} memory allocations, which in this case are 0 bytes is less
than a small allocation, which is less than or equal to 32 bytes, which is less
than a medium allocation, which is less than or equal to 256 bytes, which is
less than a large allocation, which is less than or equal to 2048 bytes, which
is less than an extra large allocation.  The numbers listed under these columns
represent a percentage of the overall total and are listed as @samp{%%} if
the percentage is 100% or as @samp{.} if the percentage is less than 1%.
Percentages of 0% are not displayed.

The information displayed in the direct allocation table is useful for seeing
exactly which functions in a program directly perform memory allocation, and can
quickly highlight where optimisations can be made or where functions might be
making unnecessary allocations.  In the example, this table shows us that 2988
bytes were allocated over 512 calls by @code{new_pair()} and that 940 bytes were
left unfreed at program termination.  All of the allocations that were made by
@code{new_pair()} were between 1 and 32 bytes in size.

@cindex call sites
We could now choose to sort the direct allocation table by the number of calls
to allocate memory, rather than the number of bytes allocated, with the
@option{-c} option to @command{mprof}, but that is not relevant in this example.
However, we know that there are two calls to allocate memory from
@code{new_pair()}, so we can use the @option{-a} option to @command{mprof} to
show all call sites within functions rather than just the total for each
function.  This option does not affect the allocation bin table so the new
output from @command{mprof} with the @option{-a} option looks like:

The names of the functions displayed in the above tables now have a byte offset
appended to them to indicate at what position in the function a call to allocate
memory occurred@footnote{If no symbols could be read from the program's
executable file, or if the corresponding symbol could not be determined, then
the function names will be replaced with the code addresses at which the calls
took place.}.  Now it is possible to see that the first call to allocate memory
from within @code{new_pair()} has had all of its memory freed, but the second
call (from @code{strdup()}) has had none of its memory freed.

@cindex memory leak table
This is also visible in the next table, which is the memory leak table and lists
all of the functions that allocated memory but did not free all of their memory
during the lifetime of the program.  The default behaviour of @command{mprof} is
to show only the function that directly allocated the memory in the memory leak
table, but this can be changed with the @option{-n} option.  This accepts an
argument specifying the maximum number of functions to display in one call
stack, with zero indicating that all functions in a call stack should be
displayed.  This can be useful for tracing down the functions that were
indirectly responsible for the memory leak.  The new memory leak table displayed
by @command{mprof} with the @option{-a} and @option{-n0} options looks like:

Now that we know where the memory leak is coming from, we can fix it by freeing
the string as well as the structure at line 77.  A version of the above
program that does not contain the memory leak can be found in
@file{tests/profile/test2.c}.

@cindex VAX
Much of the functionality of this implementation of memory allocation profiling
is based upon @command{mprof} by Benjamin Zorn and Paul Hilfinger, which was
written as a research project and ran on MIPS, SPARC and VAX machines.  However,
the profiling output files are incompatible, the tables displayed have a
different format, and the way they are implemented is entirely different.

@cindex performance improvements

Because of their need to cover every eventuality, malloc library implementations
are very general and most do their job well when you consider what is thrown at
them.  However, your program may not be performing as well as it should simply
because there may be a more efficient way of dealing with dynamic memory
allocations.  Indeed, there may even be a more efficient malloc library
available for you to use.

If you need to allocate lots of blocks of the same size@footnote{Such as for use
in a linked list.}, but you won't know the number of blocks you'll require until
run-time then you could take the easy approach by simply allocating a new block
of memory for each occurrence.  However, this is going to create a lot of
(typically small) memory blocks that the underlying malloc library will have to
keep track of, and even in many good malloc libraries this is likely to cause
memory fragmentation and possibly even result in the blocks scattered throughout
the address space rather than all in the one place, which is not necessarily a
good thing on systems with virtual memory.

An alternative approach would be to allocate memory in multiples of the block
size, so that several blocks would be allocated at once.  This would require
slightly more work on your part since you would need to write interface code to
return a single block, while possible allocating space for more blocks if no
free blocks were available.  However, this approach has several advantages.  The
first is that the malloc library only needs to keep track of a few large
allocations rather than lots of small allocations, so splitting and merging free
blocks is less likely to occur.  Secondly, your blocks will be scattered about
less in the address space of the process, which means that on systems with
virtual memory there are less likely to be page faults if you need to access or
traverse all of the blocks you have created.

@cindex arenas
@cindex Digital UNIX
@cindex amalloc
A memory allocation concept that is similar to this is called an @emph{arena}.
This datatype requires functions which are built on top of the existing malloc
library functions and which associate each memory allocation with a particular
arena.  An arena can have as many allocations added to it as required, but
allocations cannot usually be freed until the whole arena is freed.  Note that
there are not really any generic implementations of arenas that are available as
everyone tends to write their own version when they require it, although Digital
UNIX and SGI IRIX systems do come with an arena library called @emph{amalloc}.

@cindex slot tables
However, what if you don't plan to free all of the blocks at the same time?  A
slight modification to the above design could be to have a @emph{slot table}.
This would involve allocating chunks of blocks as they are required, adding each
individual block within a chunk to a singly-linked list of free blocks.  Then,
as new blocks are required, the allocator would simply choose the first block on
the free list, otherwise it would allocate memory for a new chunk of blocks and
add them to the free list.  Freeing individual blocks would simply involve
returning the block to the free list.  If this description isn't clear enough,
have a look in @file{src/slots.h} and @file{src/slots.c}.  This is how the
mpatrol library allocates memory from the system for all of its internal
structures.  For variable-sized structures, a slightly different approach needs
to be taken, but for an example of this using strings see @file{src/strtab.h}
and @file{src/strtab.c}.

Another optimisation that is possible on UNIX and Windows platforms is making
use of memory-mapped files.  This allows you to map a filesystem object into the
address space of your process, thus allowing you to treat a file as an array of
bytes.  Because it uses the virtual memory system to map the file, any changes
you make to the mapped memory will be applied to the file.  This is implemented
through the virtual memory system treating the file as a pseudo swap file and
will therefore only use up physical memory when pages are accessed.  It also
means that file operations can be replaced by memory read and write operations,
leading to a very fast and efficient way of performing I/O.  Another added bonus
of this system means that entire blocks of process memory can be written to a
file for later re-use, just as long as the file can later be mapped to the same
address.  This can be a lot faster than writing to and reading from a specific
format of file.

If you really don't want to keep track of dynamic memory allocations at all then
perhaps you should consider @emph{garbage collection}.  This allows you to make
dynamic memory allocations that need not necessarily be matched by corresponding
calls to free these allocations.  A garbage collector will (at certain points
during program execution) attempt to look for memory allocations that are no
longer referenced by the program and free them for later re-use, hence removing
all possibility of memory leaks.  However, the garbage collection process can
take a sizable chunk of processor time depending on how large the program is, so
it is not really an option for real-time programming.  It is also very
platform-dependent as it examines very low-level structures within a process in
order to determine which pointers point to which memory allocations.  But there
is at least one garbage collector@footnote{A freely distributably library
called GC (@pxref{Related software}).} that works well with C and C++ and acts
as a replacement for @code{malloc()} and @code{free()}, so it may be the ideal
solution for you.

If you do choose to use an alternative malloc library make sure that you have a
license to do so and that you follow any distribution requirements.  On systems
that support dynamic linking you may want to link the library statically rather
than dynamically so that you don't have to worry about an additional file that
would need to be installed.  However, whether you have that choice depends on
the license for the specific library, and some licenses also require that the
source code for the library be made readily available.  Shared libraries have
the advantage that they can be updated with bug fixes so that all programs that
require these libraries will automatically receive these fixes without needing
to be relinked.

@cindex performance bottleneck
If all of the above suggestions do not seem to help and you still feel that you
have a performance bottleneck in the part of your code that deals with
dynamically allocated memory then you should try using the memory allocation
profiling feature of mpatrol.  This can be used at run-time to analyse the
dynamic memory allocation calls that your program makes during its execution,
and builds statistics for later viewing with the @command{mprof} command.  It is
then possible for you to see exactly how many calls were made to each function
and where they came from.  Such information can then be put to good use in order
to optimise the relevant parts of your code.

@cindex hints
@cindex tips
And finally, some tips on how to correctly use dynamic memory allocations.  The
first, most basic rule is to @emph{always} check the return values from
@code{malloc()} and related functions.  @emph{Never} assume that a call to
@code{malloc()} will succeed, because you're unlikely to be able to read the
future@footnote{If you can, why are you reading this --- you've already read
it!}.  Alternatively, use (or write) an @code{xmalloc()} or similar function,
which calls @code{malloc()} but never returns @samp{NULL} since it will abort
instead.  With the C++ operators it is slightly different because some versions
use exceptions to indicate failure, so you should always provide a handler to
deal with this eventuality.

@cindex portability
@cindex ANSI
Never use @emph{features}@footnote{Whether they are documented or not.} of
specific malloc libraries if you want your code to be portable.  Always follow
the ANSI C or C++ calling conventions and never make assumptions about the
function or operator you are about to call --- the standards committees went to
great lengths to explicitly specify its behaviour.  For example, don't assume
that the contents of a freed memory allocation will remain valid until the next
call to @code{malloc()}, and don't assume that the contents of a newly
allocated memory block will be zeroed unless you created it with
@code{calloc()}.

@cindex stress testing
Finally, try stress-testing your program in low memory conditions.  The mpatrol
library contains the @option{LIMIT} option which can place an upper bound on the
size of the heap, and also contains the @option{FAILFREQ} and @option{FAILSEED}
options which can cause random memory allocation failures.  Doing this will test
parts of your code that you would probably never expect to be called, but
perhaps they will one day!  Who would you rather have debugging your program ---
yourself or the user?

@node How it works, Examples, Improving performance, Top
@chapter How it works
@cindex implementation details

The mpatrol library was originally written with the intention of plugging it
into an existing compiler so that the compiler could plant calls to it in the
code it generated when a specific debugging option was used.  These extra calls
would obviously slow the code down, but along with the stack checking options
that would be provided, this would give the user an enhanced run-time debugging
environment.  Unfortunately, this integration never happened, but the way that
mpatrol works is still significantly different from other malloc tracing
libraries.

@cindex best fit
@cindex first fit
@cindex allocation algorithm
In order to quickly determine exactly which memory allocation a heap address
belonged to it was necessary to be able to search the heap in an efficient
manner.  The traditional way of searching along a linked list was unfeasible,
so an implementation based on @emph{red-black trees} was used, where every known
memory allocation in the heap was given an entry in the tree, with their start
addresses as the key.  Another major design decision was to also choose
red-black trees to implement the @emph{best fit} allocation algorithm.  Although
@emph{first fit} was considered, I decided that best fit would allow the library
to have more control over the heap, with every free memory block in the heap
given an entry in the free tree, with their sizes as the key.  There was a bit
of work involved in getting the splitting and merging of free blocks to work
efficiently, but it seems to work well now.

@cindex original implementation
My original implementation had all of the information about each memory block
stored just before the block itself.  I eventually dropped that behaviour in
favour of storing all of the library's internal information in a separate part
of the heap.  I did that for two reasons.  The first was because of the problems
that would occur due to memory allocations with different alignment
requirements.  The second reason was that the library's internal structures
could be write-protected on systems with virtual memory, to prevent user code
interfering with the operation of the library.

Because the library attempts to record as much information as possible about
every memory allocation there will inevitably be a much larger memory
requirement when running a program linked with the library.  This will typically
be two or three times larger in magnitude, but will be affected by the number
of memory allocations made and also the number of symbols read.  The latter
will also affect how quickly the program starts since the first call to allocate
memory will result in the initialisation of the library and the loading of
symbols from the executable file and any shared libraries.

@cindex hidden memory
Due to its design, it is also possible to allocate memory from the heap using
the mpatrol library functions whilst already within an mpatrol library function.
This does not normally occur, but on some platforms calling @code{printf()}
from within the library may result in @code{printf()} calling @code{malloc()} to
allocate itself a buffer, which ends up as a recursive call.  Luckily, this is
dealt with by simply not displaying the allocation in the log file, but all
other details of the allocation are still recorded.  This can sometimes result
in @emph{hidden} memory usage which occurs behind the scenes and alters the peak
memory usage in the summary.  This is particularly evident when the library uses
an object file access library to read program symbols at the time of library
initialisation.

Memory allocation profiling support was added for mpatrol release 1.2.0.  Every
allocation and deallocation is recorded, with the call stack information being
used to differentiate all of the call sites within the program.  Unlike other
profilers that come with UNIX systems, even the symbolic information about the
program being run is written to the profiling output file, since it makes no
sense for @command{mprof} to re-read the symbol table from the executable file
when it has already been read and processed by the mpatrol library.  It also has
the added bonus of allowing the user to save profiling output files for later
use even when the executable files which produced them have changed or no longer
exist.

@cindex modules
The library is written in a modular fashion so as to make it easy to add new
functionality.  New modules have already been added, such as the @emph{stack},
@emph{symbol} and @emph{profile} modules.  Extra information about each memory
allocation can be added to the @emph{allocation information} module in
@file{src/info.h} and @file{src/info.c} without having to change much code in
any other files.

@node Examples, Tutorial, How it works, Top
@chapter Examples
@cindex examples

Following are a set of examples that are intended to illustrate what exactly is
possible with the mpatrol library and how to go about using it effectively.

You should already have built and installed the library and should know how to
link programs with the library.  Unfortunately, it isn't possible to give
specific instructions on how to do this as it varies from system to system and
also depends on your preferred compiler and development tools.

@cindex SVR4
However, on a typical SVR4 UNIX system, with mpatrol installed in
@file{/usr/local}, the mpatrol library can usually be incorporated into a
program using the following commands:

@itemize @bullet
@cindex COFF
@item
If the mpatrol library was built with no support for any object file format or
was built with support for the COFF object file format:

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol
@end smallexample

@cindex ELF32
@item
If the mpatrol library was built with support for the ELF32 object file format
access library:

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol -lelf
@end smallexample

@cindex BFD
@item
If the mpatrol library was built with support for the GNU BFD object file format
access library:

@smallexample
cc -I/usr/local/include <file> -L/usr/local/lib -lmpatrol -lbfd
   -liberty
@end smallexample
@end itemize

If you need to link with other libraries, make sure that they don't contain
definitions of @code{malloc()}, etc., or if they do then you must ensure that
the mpatrol library appears before them on the link line.

You should also know how to set an environment variable on your specific system.
Again, this varies from system to system and also depends on the command line
interpreter or shell that you use.  The environment variable that the mpatrol
library uses is called @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}.  You can see exactly what options
are available for this environment variable by setting it to @option{HELP} and
then running a program that has been linked with the library.

@section Getting started

@cindex crash
The first example we'll look at is when the argument in a call to @code{free()}
doesn't match the return value from @code{malloc()}, even though the intention
is to free the memory that was allocated by @code{malloc()}.  This example is in
@file{tests/fail/test1.c} and causes many existing @code{malloc()}
implementations to crash.

Along the way, I'll try to describe as many features of the mpatrol library as
possible, and illustrate them with examples.  Note that the output from your
version of the library is likely to vary slightly from that shown in the
examples, especially on non-UNIX systems.

@enumerate 1
@cindex allocation type
@cindex type of allocation
@item
Allocation type.  This generalises the type of dynamic memory operation that is
being performed, and can be one of @samp{ALLOC}, @samp{REALLOC} or @samp{FREE}.
This should make looking for all allocations, reallocations or frees in the log
file a lot easier.  Alternatively, if a memory operation function was called
then this can also be one of @samp{MEMSET}, @samp{MEMCOPY}, @samp{MEMFIND} or
@samp{MEMCMP}.

@item
Allocation function.  This is the name of the function that has been called to
allocate the memory, in this case @samp{malloc}.

@cindex allocation index
@item
Allocation index.  This is incremented every time a new memory allocation is
requested, and persists even if the memory allocation is resized with
@code{realloc()}, @code{recalloc()} or @code{expand()}, so can be useful to keep
track of a memory allocation, even if its start address changes.  The mpatrol
library may use up the first few allocation indices when it gets initialised.

@item
Size of requested allocation.

@item
Alignment for requested allocation.  This is normally the default system
alignment for general-purpose memory allocations, but may be different depending
on the type of function that is used to allocate the memory.
@end enumerate

The following information contains source file details of where the call to
@code{malloc()} came from, but is only available if the source file containing
the call to @code{malloc()} included @file{mpatrol.h}; otherwise the fields will
all be @samp{-}@footnote{This information may also be filled in if the
@option{USEDEBUG} option is used and supported, and if debugging information
about the call to @code{malloc()} is available.}.  Because of the convoluted way
this information is obtained for the C++ operators, you may encounter some
problems in existing C++ programs when making direct calls to
@code{operator new} for example.  However, if you want to disable the
redefinition of the C++ operators in @file{mpatrol.h} you can define the
preprocessor macro @code{MP_NOCPLUSPLUS} before the inclusion of that file.

@enumerate 6
@cindex gcc
@cindex g++
@item
Function where call to @code{malloc()} took place.  This information is only
available if the source file containing the call to @code{malloc()} was compiled
with @command{gcc} or @command{g++}.

@item
Filename in which call to @code{malloc()} took place.

@item
Line number at which call to @code{malloc()} took place.
@end enumerate

@cindex entry-point
The following information contains function call stack details of where the
call to @code{malloc()} came from, but is only available if the mpatrol library
has been built on a platform that supports this.  The top-most entry should be
the function which called @code{malloc()} and the bottom-most entry should be
the entry-point for the process.

@enumerate 9
@item
Address of function call.  This is normally the address of the machine
instruction immediately after the function call instruction, also known as the
return address.

@cindex C++ mangled names
@cindex mangled names
@cindex demangler
@item
Function where call took place.  This information is only available if the
mpatrol library has been built on a platform that supports reading symbol table
information from executable files, and then only if there is an entry in the
symbol table corresponding to the return address.  C++ function names may still
be in their mangled form, but this can be easily rectified by processing the
log file with a C++ name demangler.
@end enumerate

The following information is only available when the allocation type is
@samp{ALLOC} or @samp{REALLOC} since it makes no sense when applied to
@samp{FREE}.

@enumerate 11
@item
The address of the new memory block that has been allocated by @code{malloc()}.
@end enumerate

As you can see, there is quite a lot of information that can be displayed from
a simple call to @code{malloc()}, and hopefully this information has been
presented in a clear and concise format in the log file.

The next entries in the log file correspond to the call to @code{free()}, which
attempts to free the memory allocated by @code{malloc()}, but supplies the wrong
address.

The first three lines should be self-explanatory as they are very similar to
those described above for @code{malloc()}.  However, the next lines signal that
a terminal error has occurred in the program, so I've annotated them as before.

@enumerate 1
@cindex error severity
@cindex severity of errors
@cindex recoverable errors
@cindex fatal errors
@item
Error severity.  The mpatrol library has two different severities of error:
@samp{WARNING} and @samp{ERROR}.  The first is always recoverable, and serves
only to indicate that something is not quite right, and so may be useful in
determining where something started to go wrong.  The second may or may not be
recoverable, and the library terminates the program if it is fatal, displaying
any relevant information as it does this.

@item
Allocation function.  This is the name of the function used to allocate,
reallocate or free memory where the error was detected.  This may be omitted if
an error is detected elsewhere in the library.
@end enumerate

The following information is related to the information that the library has
stored about the relevant memory allocation.  This information is always
displayed in this format when details of individual memory allocations are
required.  If any information is missing then it simply means that the library
was not able to determine it when the memory block was first allocated.

@enumerate 3
@item
Address of memory allocation.

@item
Size of memory allocation.

@item
Allocation function.  This is the name of the function that was called to
allocate the memory block, in this case @samp{malloc}.  If the memory allocation
has been resized then this will be either @samp{realloc}, @samp{recalloc} or
@samp{expand}.

@item
Allocation index.

@item
Reallocation index.  This is used to count the number of times a memory
allocation has been resized with @code{realloc()}, @code{recalloc()} or
@code{expand()}.

@item
Function where original call to @code{malloc()} took place.  If the memory
allocation has been resized then this will be the name of the function which
last called @code{realloc()}, @code{recalloc()} or @code{expand()}.

@item
Filename in which original call to @code{malloc()} took place.  If the memory
allocation has been resized then this will be the filename in which the last
call to @code{realloc()}, @code{recalloc()} or @code{expand()} took place.

@item
Line number at which original call to @code{malloc()} took place.  If the memory
allocation has been resized then this will be the line number at which the last
call to @code{realloc()}, @code{recalloc()} or @code{expand()} took place.

@item
Function call stack of original memory allocation.  If the memory allocation has
been resized then this will be the call stack of the last call to
@code{realloc()}, @code{recalloc()} or @code{expand()}.
@end enumerate

So, the mpatrol library detected the error in the above program and terminated
it.  When the library terminates it always displays a summary of various memory
allocation statistics and settings that were used during the execution of the
program.

The various settings and statistics displayed by the library for the above
example have been numbered and their descriptions appear below.

@end smallexample

@enumerate 1
@item
System page size.  This value is used on some platforms when allocating and
protecting system memory.

@item
Default alignment.  This value is the minimum alignment required for general
purpose memory allocations, and is usually the alignment required by the most
restrictive datatype on a given system.  It is used when allocating memory that
has no specified alignment.  It can be changed at run-time using the
@option{DEFALIGN} option, but setting this value too small may cause the program
to crash due to bus errors which are caused by reading from or writing to
misaligned data.

@item
Overflow size.  This value is the size used by one overflow buffer.  If this is
non-zero then every memory allocation will have two overflow buffers; one on
either side.  These buffers are used by the library to detect if the program
has written too many bytes to a memory allocation, thus overflowing into one of
the buffers, but these extra checks can slow down execution speed.  It can be
changed at run-time using the @option{OFLOWSIZE} option.

@item
Overflow byte.
@item
Allocation byte.
@item
Free byte.  These values are used by the library to pre-fill blocks of memory
for checking purposes.  The overflow byte is used to fill overflow buffers, the
allocation byte is used to fill newly-allocated memory (except from
@code{calloc()} or @code{recalloc()}), and the free byte is used to fill free
blocks or freed memory allocations.  These can be changed at run-time using the
@option{OFLOWBYTE}, @option{ALLOCBYTE} and @option{FREEBYTE} options.

@item
Allocation stop.
@item
Reallocation stop.
@item
Free stop.  These values are used by the library to halt the program when run
inside a debugger whenever a specified allocation index is allocated,
reallocated or freed.  These can be changed at run-time using the
@option{ALLOCSTOP}, @option{REALLOCSTOP} and @option{FREESTOP} options.

@cindex unfreed allocations
@item
Unfreed abort.  This value is used when the program terminates and is used by
the library to check if there are more than a given number of unfreed memory
allocations.  If there are then the library will cause the program to abort
with an error.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{UNFREEDABORT}
option.

@item
Small boundary.
@item
Medium boundary.
@item
Large boundary.  These values are used in memory allocation profiling and
specify the boundaries in bytes between small, medium, large and extra large
allocations.  These can be changed at run-time using the @option{SMALLBOUND},
@option{MEDIUMBOUND} and @option{LARGEBOUND} options.

@item
Lower check range.
@item
Upper check range.  These values specify the range of allocation indices through
which the library will physically check every area of free memory and every
overflow buffer for errors.  A dash specifies that either the lower or upper
range is infinite, but if they are both zero then no such checking will ever be
performed, thus speeding up execution speed dramatically.  The library defaults
to performing checks for every allocation index.  These can be changed at
run-time using the @option{CHECK} option.

@item
Failure frequency.
@item
Failure seed.  These values are used to specify if random memory allocation
failures should occur during program execution, for the purposes of stress
testing a program.  If the failure frequency is zero then no random failures
will occur, but if it is greater than zero then the higher the number, the less
frequent the failures.  The failure seed is used internally by the mpatrol
library when generating random numbers.  If it is zero then the seed will be set
randomly, but if it is greater than zero then it will be used to generate a
predictable sequence of random numbers; i.e. two runs of the same program with
the same failure frequencies and the same failure seeds will generate exactly
the same sequence of failures.

@cindex callback functions
@cindex functions, callback
@cindex handler functions
@cindex functions, handler
@cindex prologue function
@item
Prologue function.
@cindex epilogue function
@item
Epilogue function.
@cindex low memory handler function
@item
Handler function.  These values contain addresses or names of functions that
have been installed as callback functions for the library.  These functions, if
set, will be called from the library at appropriate times during program
execution in order to handle specific events.  These can be changed at
compile-time using the @code{__mp_prologue()}, @code{__mp_epilogue()} and
@code{__mp_nomemory()} functions.

@item
Log file.  Simply contains the name of the file where all mpatrol library
diagnostics go to.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{LOGFILE}
option.

@item
Profiling file.  Contains the name of the file where all of the mpatrol
library memory allocation profiling information goes when the @option{PROF}
option is used.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{PROFFILE}
option.

@item
Program filename.  Contains the full pathname to the program's executable file.
This is used by the mpatrol library to read the symbol table in order to
provide symbolic information in function call stacks.  It can be changed at
run-time using the @option{PROGFILE} option.

@item
Symbols read.  This value contains the total number of symbols read from a
program's executable file and/or the dynamic linker, if applicable.

@item
Autosave count.  This value contains the frequency at which the mpatrol library
should periodically write the profiling data to the profiling output file.  When
the total number of profiled memory allocations and deallocations is a multiple
of this number then the current profiling information will be written to the
profiling output file.  It can be changed at run-time using the
@option{AUTOSAVE} option.

@item
Allocation count.  This value contains the total number of memory allocations
that were created by the mpatrol library.  This value may be more than expected
if the mpatrol library makes any memory allocations during initialisation.

@cindex peak memory usage
@cindex memory usage
@item
Allocation peak.  This value contains the peak memory usage set by the program
when running.  This value may be more than expected if the mpatrol library makes
any memory allocations during initialisation.

@item
Allocation limit.  This value is used to limit the amount of memory that can be
allocated by a program, which can be useful for stress-testing in simulated low
memory conditions.  It can be changed at run-time using the @option{LIMIT}
option.

@cindex memory blocks
@cindex blocks
@item
@cindex allocated blocks
Allocated blocks.
@item
@cindex freed blocks
Freed blocks.
@item
@cindex free blocks
Free blocks.  These values contain the total number of allocated, freed and
free blocks at the time the summary was produced.  A freed block is an allocated
block that has been freed but has not been returned to the free memory list for
later allocation.  These values may be different from those expected if the
mpatrol library makes any memory allocations during initialisation.

@cindex internal blocks
@item
Internal blocks.  This value contains the total number of memory blocks (of
varying sizes) that have been allocated from the system for the mpatrol library
to use internally.  These memory blocks will be write-protected on systems that
support memory protection in order to prevent the program from corrupting the
library's data structures.  This can be overridden at run-time using the
@option{NOPROTECT} option in order to speed up program execution slightly.

@cindex heap usage
@item
Total heap usage.  This value contains the total amount of system heap memory
that has been allocated by the mpatrol library.

@item
@cindex bytes compared
Total compared.
@item
@cindex bytes located
Total located.
@item
@cindex bytes copied
Total copied.
@item
@cindex bytes set
Total set.  These values contain the total number of bytes that have been
tracked by the mpatrol library in byte comparison operations (such as
@code{memcmp()}), byte location operations (such as @code{memchr()}, byte copy
operations (such as @code{memcpy()}) and byte set operations (such as
@code{memset()}) respectively.  They do not take into account any other such
operations that occur outwith these functions, such as loading and storing from
machine instructions.

@item
Total warnings.
@item
Total errors.  The library keeps a count of the total number of warnings and
errors it has displayed so that you can quickly work out this information at
program termination.

@end smallexample

@cindex tree structure
The mpatrol library stores all of its information about allocated and free
memory in tree structures so that it can quickly determine if an address belongs
to allocated or free memory, or if it even exists in the heap that is managed by
mpatrol.  The above example should illustrate this since after the allocation
had been freed, the library recognised this and reported an error.  It was
possible for the program to continue execution even after that error since
mpatrol could recover from it and return @samp{NULL}.

It is possible for mpatrol to give even more useful diagnostics in the above
situation by using the @option{NOFREE} option.  This prevents the library from
returning any freed allocations to the free memory pool, by preserving any
information about them and marking them as freed.  If you add the
@option{NOFREE} option to the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable you
should see the following entries in @file{mpatrol.log} instead.

@smallexample

@end smallexample

Note the extra information reported by @code{realloc()} since the library knows
all of the details about the freed memory allocation and when it was freed.

The @option{NOFREE} option tends to use up much more system memory than normal
since it effectively instructs the mpatrol library to allocate new memory for
every single memory allocation or reallocation.  It can also slow down program
execution when overflow buffers are used, since with each new memory allocation
the library needs to check more and more overflow buffers every time it is
called.  However, it can be quite useful for problems such as this one.  The
test in @file{tests/fail/test3.c} has a similar situation.

Normally, the @option{NOFREE} option will cause the library to fill all freed
memory allocations with the free byte.  However, the original contents of such
allocations can be preserved with the @option{PRESERVE} option.  This could
help in situations when you need to determine exactly if a program is relying on
the contents of freed memory.

@node Example 3, Example 4, Example 2, Examples
@section Detecting use of free memory

This next example illustrates how the mpatrol library is able to check to see
if anything has been written into free memory.  The test is located in
@file{tests/fail/test4.c} and simply writes a single byte into free memory.

@smallexample
23  /*
24   * Allocates a block of 16 bytes and then immediately frees it.  A

33  @{
34      char *p;

36      if (p = (char *) malloc(16))

@end smallexample

The following output was produced as part of @file{mpatrol.log}.  Note that this
test was run using the same @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} settings as the last example,
but make sure that @option{PRESERVE} is not set.

@smallexample

@end smallexample

The library was able to detect that something had been written into free memory
and could report on the memory allocation that was overwritten.  However, these
checks are only performed whenever a function in the mpatrol library is called.
In the example above, the code which wrote into free memory could have been
miles away from where the library detected the error.

On platforms that support memory protection, the library also supports the
@option{PAGEALLOC} option.  This option instructs the library to force every
single memory allocation to have a size which is a multiple of the system page
size.  Although the library still stores the original requested size, it
effectively means that no two memory allocations occupy the same page of memory.
It can then use page protection (which only operates on pages of memory) to
protect all free memory from being read from or written to, and uses similar
features to install a page of overflow buffer on either side of the allocation.

@cindex fitting allocations
However, if the requested size for the memory allocation was not a multiple of
the page size this means that there will still be unused space left over in the
allocated pages.  This problem is solved by turning the unused space into
overflow buffers that will be checked in the normal way.  The positioning of the
allocation within its pages is also important.  If you want to check for illegal
reads from the borders of the memory allocation, unless it fits exactly into its
pages then there is a chance that a program could illegally read the right-most
overflow buffer if the allocation was left-aligned, or vice-versa.  Two settings
therefore exist for the @option{PAGEALLOC} option: @option{LOWER} and
@option{UPPER}.  They refer to the placement of every memory allocation within
its constituent pages.

The following diagram illustrates the @option{PAGEALLOC} option.  In the
diagram, the system page size is assumed to be 16 bytes (very unlikely, but will
serve for this example) and each character represents 1 byte.

@smallexample
x = allocated memory
o = overflow buffer (filled with the overflow byte)
. = overflow buffer page (read and write protected)

PAGEALLOC=LOWER, allocation size is 16 bytes or
PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 16 bytes:
    ................xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx................

PAGEALLOC=LOWER, allocation size is 8 bytes:
    ................xxxxxxxxoooooooo................

PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 8 bytes:
    ................ooooooooxxxxxxxx................
@end smallexample

In our original example, if the @option{PAGEALLOC=LOWER} option is added to the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable then the following error will be
produced instead of the original error.

@smallexample
ERROR: illegal memory access at address 0x0009E008
    0x0009E000 (16 bytes) @{free:13:0@} [main|test4.c|38]

    call stack
        0x00010B1C main
        0x000109D4 _start
@end smallexample

@cindex signal handler
@cindex illegal memory accesses
On systems that support memory protection, the mpatrol library has a built-in
signal handler which catches illegal memory accesses and terminates the program.
In the above case, the freed memory was made write-protected and so could not be
written to.  The underlying virtual memory system in the operating system
noticed this and signaled this to the library immediately after it happened.

Along with the details of the freed memory allocation that was being written to,
the library also attempts to display the function call stack for the location in
the program that caused the illegal memory access, although this can be quite
unreliable.  A better solution would be to run the program in a debugger to
catch the illegal memory access.

Note that the @option{PAGEALLOC} option also modifies the behaviour of the
@option{NOFREE} and @option{PRESERVE} options when used together.  The memory
allocation being freed will always be made write-protected when the
@option{PRESERVE} option is used, otherwise it will also be made read-protected
to prevent further accesses.

Note also that the @option{PAGEALLOC=UPPER} option is potentially much less
efficient at catching illegal memory accesses than the @option{PAGEALLOC=LOWER}
option.  This is due to alignment requirements, since an allocation of 1 byte
requiring an alignment of 16 bytes cannot be placed at the very end of a page of
size 4096 bytes.  The following diagram illustrates this, using the same page
size as the last diagram.

@smallexample
x = allocated memory
o = overflow buffer (filled with the overflow byte)
. = overflow buffer page (read and write protected)

PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 16 bytes, alignment is 8 bytes:
    ................xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx................

PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 3 bytes, alignment is 1 byte:
    ................oooooooooooooxxx................

PAGEALLOC=UPPER, allocation size is 3 bytes, alignment is 8 bytes:
    ................ooooooooxxxooooo................
@end smallexample

Everything is OK until the last allocation, where the alignment requirement
means that there must be two overflow buffers.  This slows down program
execution since the library must check an additional overflow buffer, and also
means that the program would have to read six bytes beyond the end of the
allocation before the illegal memory access would be detected.

@node Example 4, Example 5, Example 3, Examples
@section Using overflow buffers

This example illustrates the use of overflow buffers and so the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable should have @option{OFLOWSIZE=2}

of this example.  The test is located in @file{tests/fail/test5.c}, and
@file{tests/fail/test6.c} is very similar.

@cindex memory dump
@cindex dumping memory
Once again, the library attempts to show you as much detail as possible about
where the corruption occurred.  Along with showing you a memory dump of the
overflow buffer that was corrupted, it also shows you the allocation to which
the overflow buffer belongs.

Using overflow buffers can reduce the speed of program execution since the
library has to check every buffer whenever it is called, and if the buffers are
larger then they'll take longer to check and will use up more memory.  However,
larger buffers mean that there is less chance of the program writing past one
memory allocation into another.

Alternatively, the @option{CHECK} option can be used to limit the number of
checks that the library has to perform, thus speeding up program execution.
This option specifies a range of allocation indices through which the library
will check overflow buffers and free memory for corruption.  Such checks occur
when they normally would, but only if the current allocation index falls within
the specified range.  This feature can be used when there is a suspicion that
free memory corruption or overflow buffer corruption occurs at a certain point
during program execution, but checking them at every library call would take too
long.

On systems which support software watch points, there is an extra option called
@option{OFLOWWATCH} which allows additional memory protection.  Watch points
allow individual bytes to be read and/or write protected as opposed to just
pages.  The @option{OFLOWWATCH} option installs software watch points at every
overflow buffer instead of requiring the library to check the integrity of the
overflow buffers, and can be used in combination with @option{PAGEALLOC}.
However, software watch points slow down program execution to a crawl since
every machine instruction must be checked individually by the system to see if
it accesses a watch point area.  Slowing the program down by a factor of 10,000
is not uncommon on some systems when the @option{OFLOWWATCH} option is used.

@section Bad memory operations

In C there are several basic memory operation functions that are often called
to perform tasks such as clearing memory, copying memory, etc.  The mpatrol
library contains replacements for these which allow for better checking of their
arguments to prevent reading and writing past the boundaries of existing memory
allocations.  The following source can be found in @file{tests/fail/test9.c}.

@smallexample
23  /*
24   * Allocates a block of 16 bytes and then attempts to zero the contents of
25   * the block.  However, a zero byte is also written 1 byte before and 1
26   * byte after the allocated block, resulting in an error in the log file.
27   */


30  #include "mpatrol.h"


33  int main(void)
34  @{
35      char *p;

37      if (p = (char *) malloc(16))
38      @{
39          memset(p - 1, 0, 18);
40          free(p);
41      @}
42      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
43  @}
@end smallexample

When this is compiled and run, the following should appear in the log file.

@smallexample
ERROR: memset: range [0x00027FFF,0x00028010] overflows [0x00028000,0x0002800F]
    0x00028000 (16 bytes) @{malloc:13:0@} [main|test9.c|37]
        0x00010B18 main
        0x00010A0C _start
@end smallexample

As you can see, the library detected that the @code{memset()} function would
have written past the boundaries of the memory allocation and reported this to
you.  It then proceeded to ignore the request to copy the memory and continued
with the execution of the program@footnote{The error can be turned into a
warning with the @option{ALLOWOFLOW} option which will also force the operation
to be performed.}.  Note that this will only be done for known memory
allocations.  Reading and writing past the boundaries of static and stack memory
allocations cannot be detected in this way.

If the @option{LOGMEMORY} option is added to the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}
environment variable then it is possible to see a log of all the mpatrol library
memory operation functions that were called during program execution.  For
example, adding this option and running the above program again will produce
something similar to the following.

@smallexample
MEMSET: memset (0x00027FFF, 18 bytes, 0x00) [main|test9.c|39]
        0x00010B18 main
        0x00010A0C _start
@end smallexample

This is similar to the tracing produced for memory allocation functions, except
that the arguments in parentheses mean different things.  For @samp{MEMSET},
the first argument represents the start of the memory block to set, the second
argument represents the number of bytes to set and the third argument represents
the actual byte to set.

For @samp{MEMCOPY}, the first argument represents the source memory block, the
second argument represents the destination memory block, the third argument
represents the number of bytes to copy and the fourth argument represents a byte
to copy up to if @code{memccpy()} is being called.  This is similar for
@samp{MEMCMP}.

For @samp{MEMFIND}, the first and second arguments represent the source memory
block and its length, while the third and fourth arguments represent the memory
block to search for and its length.  In the implementation for @code{memchr()},
the byte to search for is copied to a one byte buffer and the address of that
buffer is used as the memory block to search for.

Note that as with the memory allocation functions, @samp{MEMCMP},
@samp{MEMFIND}, @samp{MEMCOPY} and @samp{MEMSET} are used to generalise the
types of operations being performed and are followed by the names of the actual
functions being used.  In some cases the functions may use a different ordering
of parameters than that shown.

@section Incompatible function calls

This example illustrates how the mpatrol library checks for calls to
incompatible pairs of memory allocation functions.  It requires the use of
C++, although does not use any C++ features except for overloaded operators.
The source is in @file{tests/fail/test7.c}, and @file{tests/fail/test8.c} is
similar.

@smallexample
23  /*
24   * Allocates a block of 16 bytes using C++ operator new[] and then
25   * attempts to free it using C++ operator delete.
26   */


29  #include "mpatrol.h"


32  int main(void)
33  @{
34      char *p;

36      p = new char[16];
37      delete p;
38      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
39  @}
@end smallexample

The relevant parts of @file{mpatrol.log} are shown below.

@smallexample

        0x00010A28 __builtin_vec_new

        0x00010ADC main
        0x000108D0 _start
@end smallexample

This shows a call to @code{operator new[]}, closely followed by a call to
@code{operator delete}.  However, in C++ calls to @code{operator new[]} must be
matched by calls to @code{operator delete[]} and not @code{operator delete}.
Hence, the library reports this as an error and does not free the memory
allocation.

The information that we are interested in comes after the summary of library
statistics generated in the log file.  The first block of data shows a memory
map of the heap that is being handled by mpatrol.  This can be used to see
graphically where a particular allocation is located, or to look for memory
fragmentation.  The @option{SHOWMAP} option also displays this information.

Note that gaps in the memory map can either be due to space used by internal
memory blocks or to some other memory allocation library using up space.  On
some systems that don't have virtual memory, gaps are likely to be owned by
other processes or belong to the system free memory list.

The next block of data shows a summary of all freed memory allocations.  This is
only possible because the @option{NOFREE} option was also given, otherwise there
would be no details on freed memory allocations.  All of these entries show
where the allocation was freed, which can be useful if you quickly needed to see
where an allocation was freed.  The @option{SHOWFREED} option also displays this
information.

As this example was run on UNIX, the mpatrol library replaces the default
implementations of @code{malloc()}, @code{free()}, etc.  As can be seen below,
this allows the library to trace all calls to allocate dynamic memory in a
process, even from functions that were not compiled with mpatrol.  The two
functions shown below were called by the mpatrol library in order to read the
symbols from ELF object files.  However, they are located in the ELF access
library which was not compiled with mpatrol.

Note that the following data has again been cut down in size for the purposes of
this example.  The @samp{@dots{}} marks text that has been removed.

The final block of data shows a summary of all unfreed memory allocations.  This
can show up memory leaks, although the first unfreed memory allocation in this
example comes from the standard C library.  On systems such as UNIX it does not
really matter about these unfreed allocations since they will automatically be
returned to the system on process termination.

However, the second unfreed allocation shows an example of a memory leak, where
no pointers referencing that allocation remain in the program to free it with.
If this was within a loop then the program could quickly run away with memory,
causing at least a decrease in performance, and at most a memory shortage.  The
mpatrol library makes it easier to spot memory leaks.

The @option{SHOWUNFREED} option also displays this information.

@chapter Tutorial
@cindex tutorial

In this chapter we'll look at a real example of using the mpatrol library to
debug a program.  All of the following building and debugging steps were
performed on a Linux/m68k machine so the details may differ slightly on
your system, but the concepts should remain the same.  However, on systems
without virtual memory some of the steps may actually cause the machine to lock
up or crash so be aware of this if you are running such a system --- you may be
safer just reading this tutorial rather than attempting it!

This tutorial will also make use of the option @option{USEDEBUG} which displays
source-level file names and line numbers associated with symbols in call stack
tracebacks, but only if the underlying object file access library supports
reading line tables from object files and even then only if the object files
were compiled with debugging information enabled.

The program we are going to look at is a simple filter which processes its
standard input and displays the processed information on its standard output.
In this case the program converts all lowercase characters to uppercase and
removes any blank lines.  The source for the program is given below, but can
also be found in @file{tests/tutorial/test1.c}.

If you quickly skimmed over the above code then you might have noticed some
rather obvious errors, but there are also some less obvious ones hidden there
as well.  After compiling and linking with the system C compiler and libraries
it successfully runs, even when its source code is piped to it.  So if it runs,
why bother trying to debug it?

The short answer to that is that this program does in fact contain one rather
major error that is likely to prevent it from running portably on other systems.
However, for the purposes of this tutorial, we'll pretend that we've just been
handed the source code for this program and have not worked on it before.  So
let's now try to compile and link it with the mpatrol library@footnote{On UNIX
systems with dynamic linking it might also be possible to run the program under
the mpatrol command with its @option{-d} option without having to recompile or
relink, but compiling and linking with the mpatrol library is a more generic
solution across different platforms.}.

First, add the inclusion of @file{mpatrol.h} to line 34 so that we can replace
calls to @code{malloc()} and @code{free()} with their mpatrol
equivalents@footnote{This is not strictly necessary on UNIX and Windows
platforms (and AmigaOS when using @command{gcc}), but it does give us more
debugging information.}.  Then, recompile the program and link it with the
mpatrol library.  This time, running it with even the simplest of non-empty
input lines should cause it to abort!

If you look at the @file{mpatrol.log} file produced, you should see something
along the lines of the following at the end of the log file.

This tells us that something has written a zero byte into free memory at
location @samp{0x8000706C}.  Unfortunately, the library only caught it at the
next call to one of its functions so it had already happened somewhere in
between the last call and the current call.  Turning on the @option{LOGALL}
option in the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable allows us to see the
last successful function call to the mpatrol library.

@smallexample
ALLOC: malloc (50, 8192 bytes, 2 bytes) [main|test1.c|54]
        0x80000A30 main (/usr/users/homedir/graeme/test1.c:54)

        0x80000944 _start

returns 0x80007068
@end smallexample

Unfortunately, this only tells us that the last successful mpatrol library
function call was @code{malloc()} called from @code{strtoupper()}.  If we add
the option @option{OFLOWSIZE=8} to the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment
variable then we get slightly more information about which memory allocation was
affected@footnote{Note that the start address of the allocation has changed
slightly since we added padding around it with the @option{OFLOWSIZE} option.}.

@smallexample
ERROR: allocation 0x80007080 has a corrupted overflow buffer at 0x80007084

        0x80000944 _start
@end smallexample

Now we can make a better guess about what is happening.  Since the start of
the upper overflow buffer of allocation 51 has been written to, we can assume
that something has written one byte beyond the end of that memory allocation.
You can probably see where that is happening now by looking at the code, but
let's try to be even more sure that this is what is wrong.

The only foolproof way to do this is to add a software watch point to keep an
eye on the address that is being written to.  This can normally only be done
within a debugger, but on systems that support programmable software watch
points, the @option{OFLOWWATCH} option can be used to do the same thing.  For
the sake of generality, we'll use the debugger watch point approach, in this
case with @command{gdb}.  In order for the following example to work correctly
you'll need to add the @option{ALLOCSTOP=51} option to the
@env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment variable so that we can stop just after the
last successful memory allocation.

@end smallexample

After loading the program into @command{gdb}, we need to break at @code{main()}
so that we can run to a point where all of the shared library symbols have been
loaded into memory@footnote{This is only necessary when the mpatrol library has
been built as a shared library.}.  We can then set another breakpoint at
@code{__mp_trap()} and continue until allocation 51 has been reached.

Because the mpatrol library has not been built with debugging information in
this example we can quickly step back to the @code{strtoupper()} function since
@command{gdb} won't step through functions that have no debugging information.
We then set a watch point on address @samp{0x80007084}, which is the address of
the memory location that has been causing the problems.  After continuing, the
debugger stops at line 46, but this is more likely to be line 45 since that is
where a zero byte is being written to@footnote{This is not necessarily the fault
of the debugger or the debugging information generated by the compiler since
on most platforms such watchpoints can only be caught after they occur, hence
most debuggers show the next statement to be executed rather than the current
one.}.

So, we have located the problem, which is simply a case of not allocating
enough memory to contain the copied string @emph{and} the terminating zero byte.
We can also improve the @code{strtoupper()} function by checking the pointer
returned by @code{malloc()} to see if it is @samp{NULL}, and if so simply exit
with an error.  You can try running the program with the @option{FAILFREQ}
option to see how it would originally behave in a low memory situation.

The following listing shows the above modifications that we have made to our
program.  It can also be found in @file{tests/tutorial/test2.c}.

Leaving aside the obvious problem with @code{gets()} and the general
inefficiency of the algorithm, we could assume that our program works safely
now and we can release it to the outside world.  However, a user soon reports
a problem with our program steadily using more and more memory during its
execution when processing very large files.

This is generally attributable to a memory leak and so we can use the
@option{SHOWUNFREED} option to try to detect where the memory leak is coming
from.  Following is some example output from the mpatrol log file when our
program is run and is given a relatively small text file as input.

We can discount the first entry since that is obviously coming from when the
mpatrol library first initialises itself.  However, all of the other entries
appear to be coming from line 43 within @code{strtoupper()} and appear to be
only 1 byte in length.  At that point in the code, the only possible reason
for allocating 1 byte is when the string is empty and so that must mean that
we are not freeing memory that contains empty strings.  Looking at line 66 we
can see that @code{free()} is only ever called for non-empty strings and
therefore if we move the call to @code{free()} outside the test for an empty
string we will fix the memory leak.  The file @file{tests/tutorial/test3.c}
contains the source for the final program.

@appendix Functions
@cindex functions

@cindex mpatrol.h
@cindex MPATROL_VERSION
The mpatrol library contains implementations of dynamic memory allocation
functions for C and C++ suitable for tracing and debugging.  The library is
intended to be used without requiring any changes to existing user source code
except the inclusion of the @file{mpatrol.h} header file, although additional
functions are supplied for extra tracing and control.  Note that the current
version of the mpatrol library is contained in the @code{MPATROL_VERSION}
preprocessor macro.

@cindex NDEBUG
All of the function definitions in @file{mpatrol.h} can be disabled by defining
the @code{NDEBUG} preprocessor macro, which is the same macro used to control
the behaviour of the @code{assert()} function.  If @code{NDEBUG} is defined then
no macro redefinition of functions will take place and all special mpatrol
library functions will evaluate to empty statements.  It is intended that the
@code{NDEBUG} preprocessor macro be defined in release builds.

The following 14 functions are available as replacements for existing C library
functions.  To use these you must include @file{mpatrol.h} before all other
header files, although on UNIX and Windows platforms (and AmigaOS when using
@command{gcc}) they will be used anyway, albeit with slightly less tracing
information.

@table @asis
@findex malloc
@item @code{void *malloc(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned
for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes
in length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the
heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set
to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()}
or reallocated with @code{realloc()}.

@findex calloc
@item @code{void *calloc(size_t nelem, size_t size)}
Allocates @var{nelem} elements of @var{size} zero-initialised bytes from the
heap and returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer
returned will be suitably aligned for casting to any type and can be used to
store data of up to @code{nelem * size} bytes in length.  If @code{nelem * size}
is @samp{0} then the amount of memory allocated will be implicitly rounded up to
@samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the @samp{NULL}
pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The
allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or reallocated with
@code{realloc()}.

@findex memalign
@item @code{void *memalign(size_t align, size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be aligned to
@var{align} bytes and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes in
length.  If @var{align} is zero then the default system alignment will be used.
If @var{align} is not a power of two then it will be rounded up to the nearest
power of two.  If @var{align} is greater than the system page size then it will
be truncated to that value.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated
will be implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in
the heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be
set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with
@code{free()} or reallocated with @code{realloc()}, although the latter will not
guarantee the preservation of alignment.

@findex valloc
@item @code{void *valloc(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be aligned to the
system page size and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes in
length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be implicitly
rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or
reallocated with @code{realloc()}, although the latter will not guarantee the
preservation of alignment.

@findex pvalloc
@item @code{void *pvalloc(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be aligned to the
system page size and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes in
length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be implicitly
rounded up to @samp{1} page, otherwise @var{size} will be implicitly rounded up
to a multiple of the system page size.  If there is not enough space in the heap
then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or
reallocated with @code{realloc()}, although the latter will not guarantee the
preservation of alignment.

@findex strdup
@item @code{char *strdup(const char *str)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If there is not enough space in the heap
then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or
reallocated with @code{realloc()}.

@findex strndup
@item @code{char *strndup(const char *str, size_t size)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If the length of @var{str} is greater
than @var{size} then only @var{size} characters will be allocated and copied,
with one additional byte for the nul character.  If there is not enough space in
the heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be
set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with
@code{free()} or reallocated with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available
for backwards compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new
code.

@findex strsave
@item @code{char *strsave(const char *str)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If there is not enough space in the heap
then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} or
reallocated with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available for backwards
compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new code.

@findex strnsave
@item @code{char *strnsave(const char *str, size_t size)}
Allocates exactly enough memory from the heap to duplicate @var{str} (including
the terminating nul character) and returns a pointer to the first byte of the
allocation after copying @var{str} to the newly-allocated memory.  The pointer
returned will have no alignment constraints and can be used to store character
data up to the length of @var{str}.  If @var{str} is @samp{NULL} then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If the length of @var{str} is greater
than @var{size} then only @var{size} characters will be allocated and copied,
with one additional byte for the nul character.  If there is not enough space in
the heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be
set to @code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with
@code{free()} or reallocated with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available
for backwards compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new
code.

@findex realloc
@item @code{void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)}
Resizes the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{size} bytes and
returns a pointer to the first byte of the new allocation after copying
@var{ptr} to the newly-allocated memory, which will be truncated if @var{size}
is smaller than the original allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably
aligned for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to
@var{size} bytes in length.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then the call will be
equivalent to @code{malloc()}.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the existing
memory allocation will be freed and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.
If @var{size} is greater than the original allocation then the extra space will
be filled with uninitialised bytes.  If there is not enough space in the heap
then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} and
can be reallocated again with @code{realloc()}.

@findex recalloc
@item @code{void *recalloc(void *ptr, size_t nelem, size_t size)}
Resizes the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{nelem} elements of
@var{size} bytes and returns a pointer to the first byte of the new allocation
after copying @var{ptr} to the newly-allocated memory, which will be truncated
if @code{nelem * size} is smaller than the original allocation.  The pointer
returned will be suitably aligned for casting to any type and can be used to
store data of up to @code{nelem * size} bytes in length.  If @var{ptr} is
@samp{NULL} then the call will be equivalent to @code{calloc()}.  If
@code{nelem * size} is @samp{0} then the existing memory allocation will be
freed and the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If @code{nelem * size} is
greater than the original allocation then the extra space will be filled with
zero-initialised bytes.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} and
can be reallocated again with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available for
backwards compatibility with older C libraries and @code{calloc()} and should
not be used in new code.

@findex expand
@item @code{void *expand(void *ptr, size_t size)}
Attempts to resize the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} to @var{size}
bytes and either returns @var{ptr} if there was enough space to resize it, or
@samp{NULL} if the block could not be resized for a particular reason.  If
@var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then the call will be equivalent to @code{malloc()}.
If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the existing memory allocation will be freed and
the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned.  If @var{size} is greater than the
original allocation then the extra space will be filled with uninitialised bytes
and if @var{size} is less than the original allocation then the memory block
will be truncated.  If there is not enough space in the heap then the
@samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set to
@code{ENOMEM}.  The allocated memory must be deallocated with @code{free()} and
can be reallocated again with @code{realloc()}.  This function is available for
backwards compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new
code.

@findex free
@item @code{void free(void *ptr)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory
will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be destroyed.

@findex cfree
@item @code{void cfree(void *ptr, size_t nelem, size_t size)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory
will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be destroyed.  The @var{nelem}
and @var{size} parameters are ignored in this implementation.  This function is
available for backwards compatibility with older C libraries and @code{calloc()}
and should not be used in new code.
@end table

@cindex MP_NOCPLUSPLUS
The following 5 functions are available as replacements for existing C++ library
functions, but the replacements in @file{mpatrol.h} will only be used if the
@code{MP_NOCPLUSPLUS} preprocessor macro is not defined.  To use these you must
include @file{mpatrol.h} before all other header files, although on UNIX and
Windows platforms (and AmigaOS when using @command{gcc}) they will be used
anyway, albeit with slightly less tracing information.

@table @asis
@findex operator new
@item @code{void *operator new(size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned
for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes
in length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the
heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set
to @code{ENOMEM} --- no exceptions will be thrown.  The allocated memory must be
deallocated with @code{operator delete}.

@findex operator new[]
@item @code{void *operator new[](size_t size)}
Allocates @var{size} uninitialised bytes from the heap and returns a pointer to
the first byte of the allocation.  The pointer returned will be suitably aligned
for casting to any type and can be used to store data of up to @var{size} bytes
in length.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then the memory allocated will be
implicitly rounded up to @samp{1} byte.  If there is not enough space in the
heap then the @samp{NULL} pointer will be returned and @code{errno} will be set
to @code{ENOMEM} --- no exceptions will be thrown.  The allocated memory must be
deallocated with @code{operator delete[]}.

@findex operator delete
@item @code{void operator delete(void *ptr)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory
will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be destroyed.  This function
must only be used with memory allocated by @code{operator new}.

@findex operator delete[]
@item @code{void operator delete[](void *ptr)}
Frees the memory allocation beginning at @var{ptr} so the memory can be reused
by another call to allocate memory.  If @var{ptr} is @samp{NULL} then no memory
will be freed.  All of the previous contents will be destroyed.  This function
must only be used with memory allocated by @code{operator new[]}.

@findex set_new_handler
@item @code{void (*set_new_handler(void (*func)(void)))(void)}
Installs a low-memory handler specifically for use with @code{operator new} and
@code{operator new[]} and returns a pointer to the previously installed handler,
or the @samp{NULL} pointer if no handler had been previously installed.  This
will be called repeatedly by both functions when they would normally return
@samp{NULL}, and this loop will continue until they manage to allocate the
requested space.  The default low-memory handler for the C++ operators will
terminate the program and write an out of memory message to the log file.  Note
that this function is equivalent to @code{__mp_nomemory()} and will replace the
handler installed by that function.
@end table

The following 10 functions are available as replacements for existing C library
memory operation functions.  To use these you must include @file{mpatrol.h}
before all other header files, although on UNIX and Windows platforms (and
AmigaOS when using @command{gcc}) they will be used anyway, albeit with slightly
less tracing information.

@table @asis
@findex memset
@item @code{void *memset(void *ptr, int byte, size_t size)}
Writes @var{size} bytes of value @var{byte} to the memory location beginning at
@var{ptr} and returns @var{ptr}.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} then no bytes will
be written.  If the operation would affect an existing memory allocation in the
heap but would straddle that allocation's boundaries then an error message will
be generated in the log file and no bytes will be written.

@findex bzero
@item @code{void bzero(void *ptr, size_t size)}
Writes @var{size} zero bytes to the memory location beginning at @var{ptr}.  If
@var{size} is @samp{0} then no bytes will be written.  If the operation would
affect an existing memory allocation in the heap but would straddle that
allocation's boundaries then an error message will be generated in the log file
and no bytes will be written.  This function is available for backwards
compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new code.

@findex memccpy
@item @code{void *memccpy(void *dest, const void *src, int byte, size_t size)}
Copies @var{size} bytes from @var{src} to @var{dest} and returns @samp{NULL}, or
copies the number of bytes up to and including the first occurrence of
@var{byte} if @var{byte} exists within the specified range and returns a pointer
to the first byte after @var{byte}.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} or @var{src} is
the same as @var{dest} then no bytes will be copied.  The source and destination
ranges should not overlap, otherwise a warning will be written to the log file.
If the operation would affect an existing memory allocation in the heap but
would straddle that allocation's boundaries then an error message will be
generated in the log file and no bytes will be copied.

@findex memcpy
@item @code{void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t size)}
Copies @var{size} bytes from @var{src} to @var{dest} and returns @var{dest}.  If
@var{size} is @samp{0} or @var{src} is the same as @var{dest} then no bytes will
be copied.  The source and destination ranges should not overlap, otherwise a
warning will be written to the log file.  If the operation would affect an
existing memory allocation in the heap but would straddle that allocation's
boundaries then an error message will be generated in the log file and no bytes
will be copied.

@findex memmove
@item @code{void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t size)}
Copies @var{size} bytes from @var{src} to @var{dest} and returns @var{dest}.  If
@var{size} is @samp{0} or @var{src} is the same as @var{dest} then no bytes will
be copied.  If the operation would affect an existing memory allocation in the
heap but would straddle that allocation's boundaries then an error message will
be generated in the log file and no bytes will be copied.

@findex bcopy
@item @code{void bcopy(const void *src, void *dest, size_t size)}
Copies @var{size} bytes from @var{src} to @var{dest}.  If @var{size} is @samp{0}
or @var{src} is the same as @var{dest} then no bytes will be copied.  If the
operation would affect an existing memory allocation in the heap but would
straddle that allocation's boundaries then an error message will be generated in
the log file and no bytes will be copied.  This function is available for
backwards compatibility with older C libraries and should not be used in new
code.

@findex memcmp
@item @code{int memcmp(const void *ptr1, const void *ptr2, size_t size)}
Compares @var{size} bytes from @var{ptr1} and @var{ptr2} and returns @samp{0} if
all of the bytes are identical, or returns the byte difference of the first
differing bytes.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} or @var{ptr1} is the same as
@var{ptr2} then no bytes will be compared.  If the operation would read from an
existing memory allocation in the heap but would straddle that allocation's
boundaries then an error message will be generated in the log file and no bytes
will be compared.

@findex bcmp
@item @code{int bcmp(const void *ptr1, const void *ptr2, size_t size)}
Compares @var{size} bytes from @var{ptr1} and @var{ptr2} and returns @samp{0} if
all of the bytes are identical, or returns the byte difference of the first
differing bytes.  If @var{size} is @samp{0} or @var{ptr1} is the same as
@var{ptr2} then no bytes will be compared.  If the operation would read from an
existing memory allocation in the heap but would straddle that allocation's
boundaries then an error message will be generated in the log file and no bytes
will be compared.  This function is available for backwards compatibility with
older C libraries and should not be used in new code.

@findex memchr
@item @code{void *memchr(const void *ptr, int byte, size_t size)}
Searches up to @var{size} bytes in @var{ptr} for the first occurrence of
@var{byte} and returns a pointer to it or @samp{NULL} if no such byte occurs.
If @var{size} is @samp{0} then no bytes will be searched.  If the operation
would affect an existing memory allocation in the heap but would straddle that
allocation's boundaries then an error message will be generated in the log file
and no bytes will be searched.

@findex memmem
@item @code{void *memmem(const void *ptr1, size_t size1, const void *ptr2, size_t size2)}
Searches up to @var{size1} bytes in @var{ptr1} for the first occurrence of
@var{ptr2} (which is exactly @var{size2} bytes in length) and returns a pointer
to it or @samp{NULL} if no such sequence of bytes occur.  If @var{size1} or
@var{size2} is @samp{0} then no bytes will be searched.  If the operation would
affect an existing memory allocation in the heap but would straddle that
allocation's boundaries then an error message will be generated in the log file
and no bytes will be searched.
@end table

The following 8 functions are available as support routines for additional
control and tracing in the mpatrol library.  To use these you should include the
@file{mpatrol.h} header file.

@table @asis
@findex __mp_info
@cindex allocation information
@cindex information about an allocation
@item @code{int __mp_info(const void *ptr, __mp_allocinfo *info)}
Obtains information about a specific memory allocation by placing statistics
about @var{ptr} in @var{info}.  If @var{ptr} does not belong to a previously

@item @code{freed}
@tab Indicates if allocation has been freed.
@end multitable

@findex __mp_printinfo
@item @code{int __mp_printinfo(const void *ptr)}
Displays information about a specific memory allocation containing @var{ptr} to
the standard error file stream.  If @var{ptr} does not belong to a previously
allocated memory allocation then @samp{0} will be returned, otherwise @samp{1}
will be returned.  This function is intended to be called from within a
debugger.

@findex __mp_memorymap
@item @code{void __mp_memorymap(int stats)}
If @var{stats} is non-zero then the current statistics of the mpatrol library
will be displayed.  If the heap contains at least one allocated, freed or free
block then a map of the current heap will also be displayed.

@findex __mp_summary
@item @code{void __mp_summary(void)}
Displays information about the current state of the mpatrol library, including
its settings and any relevant statistics.

@findex __mp_check
@item @code{void __mp_check(void)}
Forces the library to perform an immediate check of the overflow buffers of
every memory allocation and to ensure that nothing has overwritten any free
blocks.

@findex __mp_prologue
@item @code{void (*__mp_prologue(void (*func)(const void *, size_t)))(const void *, size_t)}
Installs a prologue function to be called before any memory allocation,
reallocation or deallocation function.  This function will return a pointer to
the previously installed prologue function, or the @samp{NULL} pointer if no
prologue function had been previously installed.  The following arguments will
be used to call the prologue function:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2 .6
@item @emph{Argument 1}
@tab @emph{Argument 2}
@tab @emph{Called by}
@item @code{-1}
@tab @var{size}
@tab @code{malloc()}, etc.
@item @var{ptr}
@tab @var{size}
@tab @code{realloc()}, etc.
@item @var{ptr}
@tab @code{-1}
@tab @code{free()}, etc.
@item @var{ptr}
@tab @code{-2}
@tab @code{strdup()}, etc.
@end multitable

@findex __mp_epilogue
@item @code{void (*__mp_epilogue(void (*func)(const void *)))(const void *)}
Installs an epilogue function to be called after any memory allocation,
reallocation or deallocation function.  This function will return a pointer to
the previously installed epilogue function, or the @samp{NULL} pointer if no
epilogue function had been previously installed.  The following arguments will
be used to call the epilogue function:

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .8
@item @emph{Argument}
@tab @emph{Called by}
@item @var{ptr}
@tab @code{malloc()}, @code{realloc()}, @code{strdup()}, etc.
@item @code{-1}

@item @code{void (*__mp_nomemory(void (*func)(void)))(void)}
Installs a low-memory handler and returns a pointer to the previously installed
handler, or the @samp{NULL} pointer if no handler had been previously installed.
This will be called once by C memory allocation functions, and repeatedly by C++
memory allocation functions, when they would normally return @samp{NULL}.  Note
that this function is equivalent to @code{set_new_handler()} and will replace
the handler installed by that function.
@end table

@node Environment, Options, Functions, Top
@appendix Environment
@cindex environment

@cindex MPATROL_OPTIONS
The library can read certain options at run-time from an environment variable
called @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS}.  This variable must contain one or more valid
option keywords from the list below and must be no longer than 1024 characters
in length.  If @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} is unset or empty then the default settings
will be used.

@cindex binary
@cindex octal
@cindex decimal
@cindex hexadecimal
The syntax for options specified within the @env{MPATROL_OPTIONS} environment
variable is @samp{OPTION} or @samp{OPTION=VALUE}, where @samp{OPTION} is a
keyword from the list below and @samp{VALUE} is the setting for that option.  If
@samp{VALUE} is numeric then it may be specified using binary, octal, decimal or
hexadecimal notation, with binary notation beginning with either @samp{0b} or
@samp{0B}.  If @samp{VALUE} is a character string containing spaces then it may
be quoted using double quotes.  No whitespace may appear between the @samp{=}
sign, but whitespace must appear between different options.  Note that option
keywords can be given in lowercase as well as uppercase, or a mixture of both.

@table @asis
@cindex ALLOCBYTE
@item @option{ALLOCBYTE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an 8-bit byte pattern with which to prefill newly-allocated memory.
This can be used to detect the use of memory which has not been initialised
after allocation.  Note that this setting will not affect memory allocated with
@code{calloc()} or @code{recalloc()} as these functions always prefill allocated
memory with an 8-bit byte pattern of zero.  Default value:
@option{ALLOCBYTE=0xFF}.

@cindex ALLOCSTOP
@item @option{ALLOCSTOP}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an allocation index at which to stop the program when it is being
allocated.  When the number of memory allocations reaches this number the
program will be halted, and its state may be examined at that point by using a
suitable debugger.  Note that this setting will be ignored if its value is zero.
Default value: @option{ALLOCSTOP=0}.

@cindex ALLOWOFLOW
@item @option{ALLOWOFLOW}
Specifies that a warning rather than an error should be produced if any memory
operation function overflows the boundaries of a memory allocation, and that
the operation should still be performed.  This option is provided for
circumstances where it is desirable for the memory operation to be performed,
regardless of whether it is erroneous or not.

@cindex AUTOSAVE
@item @option{AUTOSAVE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the frequency at which to periodically write the profiling data to
the profiling output file.  When the total number of profiled memory allocations
and deallocations is a multiple of this number then the current profiling
information will be written to the profiling output file.  This option can be
used to instruct the mpatrol library to dump out any profiling information just
before a fatal error occurs in a program, for example.  Note that this setting
will be ignored if its value is zero.  Default value: @option{AUTOSAVE=0}.

@cindex CHECK
@item @option{CHECK}=<@var{unsigned-range}>
Specifies a range of allocation indices at which to check the integrity of free
memory and overflow buffers.  The range must be specified as no more than two
unsigned integers separated by a dash.  If numbers on either the left side or
the right side of the dash are omitted then they will be assumed to be @samp{0}
and @var{infinity} respectively.  A value of @samp{0} on its own indicates that
no such checking will ever be performed.  This option can be used to speed up
the execution speed of the library at the expense of checking.  Default value:
@option{CHECK=-}.

@cindex CHECKALL
@item @option{CHECKALL}
Equivalent to the @option{CHECKALLOCS}, @option{CHECKREALLOCS} and
@option{CHECKFREES} options specified together.

@cindex CHECKALLOCS
@item @option{CHECKALLOCS}
Checks that no attempt is made to allocate a block of memory of size zero.  A
warning will be issued for every such case.

@cindex CHECKFREES
@item @option{CHECKFREES}
Checks that no attempt is made to deallocate a @samp{NULL} pointer.  A warning
will be issued for every such case.

@cindex CHECKREALLOCS
@item @option{CHECKREALLOCS}
Checks that no attempt is made to reallocate a @samp{NULL} pointer or resize an
existing block of memory to size zero.  Warnings will be issued for every such
case.

@cindex DEFALIGN
@item @option{DEFALIGN}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the default alignment for general-purpose memory allocations, which
must be a power of two (and will be rounded up to the nearest power of two if it
is not).  The default alignment for a particular system is calculated at
run-time.

@cindex FAILFREQ
@item @option{FAILFREQ}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the frequency at which all memory allocations will randomly fail.  For
example, a value of @samp{10} will mean that roughly 1 in 10 memory allocations
will fail, but a value of @samp{0} will disable all random failures.  This
option can be useful for stress-testing an application.  Default value:
@option{FAILFREQ=0}.

@cindex FAILSEED
@item @option{FAILSEED}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the random number seed which will be used when determining which
memory allocations will randomly fail.  A value of @samp{0} will instruct the
library to pick a random seed every time it is run.  Any other value will mean
that the random failures will be the same every time the program is run, but
only as long as the seed stays the same.  Default value: @option{FAILSEED=0}.

@cindex FREEBYTE
@item @option{FREEBYTE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an 8-bit byte pattern with which to prefill newly-freed memory.  This
can be used to detect the use of memory which has just been freed.  It is also
used internally to ensure that freed memory has not been overwritten.  Note that
the freed memory may be reused the next time a block of memory is allocated and
so once memory has been freed its contents are not guaranteed to remain the same
as the specified byte pattern.  Default value: @option{FREEBYTE=0x55}.

@cindex FREESTOP
@item @option{FREESTOP}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an allocation index at which to stop the program when it is being
freed.  When the memory allocation with the specified allocation index is to be
freed the program will be halted, and its state may be examined at that point
using a suitable debugger.  Note that this setting will be ignored if its value
is zero.  Default value: @option{FREESTOP=0}.

@cindex HELP
@cindex option summary
@cindex summary of options
@item @option{HELP}
Displays a quick-reference option summary to the @code{stderr} file stream.

@cindex LARGEBOUND
@item @option{LARGEBOUND}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the limit in bytes up to which memory allocations should be classified
as large allocations for profiling purposes.  This limit must be greater than
the small and medium bounds.  Default value: @option{LARGEBOUND=2048}.

@cindex LIMIT
@item @option{LIMIT}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the limit in bytes at which all memory allocations should fail if the
total allocated memory should increase beyond this.  This can be used to
stress-test software to see how it behaves in low memory conditions.  The
internal memory used by the library itself will not be counted as part of the
total heap size, but on some systems there may be a small amount of memory
required to initialise the library itself.  Note that this setting will be
ignored if its value is zero.  Default value: @option{LIMIT=0}.

@cindex LOGALL
@item @option{LOGALL}
Equivalent to the @option{LOGALLOCS}, @option{LOGREALLOCS}, @option{LOGFREES}
and @option{LOGMEMORY} options specified together.

@cindex LOGALLOCS
@item @option{LOGALLOCS}
Specifies that all memory allocations are to be logged and sent to the log file.
Note that any memory allocations made internally by the library will not be
logged.

@cindex LOGFILE
@item @option{LOGFILE}=<@var{string}>
Specifies an alternative file in which to place all diagnostics from the mpatrol
library.  A filename of @samp{stderr} will send all diagnostics to the
@code{stderr} file stream and a filename of @samp{stdout} will do the equivalent
with the @code{stdout} file stream.  Note that if a problem occurs while opening
the log file or if any diagnostics require to be displayed before the log file
has had a chance to be opened then they will be sent to the @code{stderr} file
stream.  Default value: @option{LOGFILE=mpatrol.log}.

@cindex LOGFREES
@item @option{LOGFREES}
Specifies that all memory deallocations are to be logged and sent to the log
file.  Note that any memory deallocations made internally by the library will
not be logged.

@cindex LOGMEMORY
@item @option{LOGMEMORY}
Specifies that all memory operations are to be logged and sent to the log file.
These operations will be made by calls to functions such as @code{memset()} and
@code{memcpy()}.  Note that any memory operations made internally by the library
will not be logged.

@cindex LOGREALLOCS
@item @option{LOGREALLOCS}
Specifies that all memory reallocations are to be logged and sent to the log
file.  Note that any memory reallocations made internally by the library will
not be logged.

@cindex MEDIUMBOUND
@item @option{MEDIUMBOUND}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the limit in bytes up to which memory allocations should be classified
as medium allocations for profiling purposes.  This limit must be greater than
the small bound but less than the large bound.  Default value:
@option{MEDIUMBOUND=256}.

@cindex NOFREE
@item @option{NOFREE}
Specifies that the mpatrol library should keep all reallocated and freed memory
allocations.  Such freed memory allocations will then be flagged as freed and
can be used by the library to provide better diagnostics.  However, as no system
memory will ever be reused by the mpatrol library, this option can quickly lead
to a shortage of available system memory for a process.  Note that this option
will always force a memory reallocation to return a pointer to newly-allocated
memory, but the @code{expand()} function will never be affected by this option.

@cindex NOPROTECT
@item @option{NOPROTECT}
Specifies that the mpatrol library's internal data structures should not be made
read-only after every memory allocation reallocation or deallocation.  This may
significantly speed up execution but this will be at the expense of less safety
if the program accidentally overwrites some of the library's internal data
structures.  Note that this option has no effect on systems that do not support
memory protection.

@cindex OFLOWBYTE
@item @option{OFLOWBYTE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies an 8-bit byte pattern with which to fill the overflow buffers of all
memory allocations.  This is used internally to ensure that nothing has been
written beyond the beginning or the end of a block of allocated memory.  Note
that this setting will only have an effect if the @option{OFLOWSIZE} option is
in use.  Default value: @option{OFLOWBYTE=0xAA}.

@cindex OFLOWSIZE
@item @option{OFLOWSIZE}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the size in bytes to use for all overflow buffers, which must be a
power of two (and will be rounded up to the nearest power of two if it is not).
This is used internally to ensure that nothing has been written beyond the
beginning or the end of a block of allocated memory.  Note that this setting
specifies the size for only one of the overflow buffers given to each memory
allocation; the other overflow buffer will have an identical size.  No overflow
buffers will be used if this setting is zero.  Default value:
@option{OFLOWSIZE=0}.

@cindex OFLOWWATCH
@item @option{OFLOWWATCH}
Specifies that watch point areas should be used for overflow buffers rather than
filling with the overflow byte.  This can significantly reduce the speed of
program execution.  Note that this option has no effect on systems that do not
support watch point areas.

@cindex PAGEALLOC
@item @option{PAGEALLOC}=<@option{LOWER}|@option{UPPER}>
Specifies that each individual memory allocation should occupy at least one
page of virtual memory and should be placed at the lowest or highest point
within these pages.  This allows the library to place an overflow buffer of one
page on either side of every memory allocation and write-protect these pages as
well as all free and freed memory.  Note that this option has no effect on
systems that do not support memory protection, and is disabled by default on
other systems as it can slow down the speed of program execution.

@cindex PRESERVE
@item @option{PRESERVE}
Specifies that any reallocated or freed memory allocations should preserve their
original contents.  This option must be used with the @option{NOFREE} option and
has no effect otherwise.

@cindex PROF
@item @option{PROF}
Specifies that all memory allocations and deallocations are to be profiled and
sent to the profiling output file.  Memory reallocations are treated as a
memory deallocation immediately followed by a memory allocation.

@cindex PROFFILE
@item @option{PROFFILE}=<@var{string}>
Specifies an alternative file in which to place all memory allocation profiling
information from the mpatrol library.  A filename of @samp{stderr} will send
this information to the @code{stderr} file stream and a filename of
@samp{stdout} will do the equivalent with the @code{stdout} file stream.  Note
that if a problem occurs while opening the profiling output file then the
profiling information will be sent to the @code{stderr} file stream.  Default
value: @option{PROFFILE=mpatrol.out}.

@cindex PROGFILE
@item @option{PROGFILE}=<@var{string}>
Specifies an alternative filename with which to locate the executable file
containing the program's symbols.  On most systems, the library will
automatically be able to determine this filename, but on a few systems this
option may have to be used before any or all symbols can be read.

@cindex REALLOCSTOP
@item @option{REALLOCSTOP}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies a reallocation index at which to stop the program when a memory
allocation is being reallocated.  If the @option{ALLOCSTOP} option is non-zero
then the program will be halted when the allocation matching that allocation
index is reallocated the specified number of times.  Otherwise the program will
be halted the first time any allocation is reallocated the specified number of
times.  Note that this setting will be ignored if its value is zero.  Default
value: @option{REALLOCSTOP=0}.

@cindex SAFESIGNALS
@item @option{SAFESIGNALS}
Instructs the library to save and replace certain signal handlers during the
execution of library code and to restore them afterwards.  This was the default
behaviour in version 1.0 of the mpatrol library and was changed since some
memory-intensive programs became very hard to interrupt using the keyboard,
thus giving the impression that the program or system had hung.

@cindex SHOWALL
@item @option{SHOWALL}
Equivalent to the @option{SHOWFREED}, @option{SHOWUNFREED}, @option{SHOWMAP} and
@option{SHOWSYMBOLS} options specified together.

@cindex SHOWFREED
@item @option{SHOWFREED}
Specifies that a summary of all of the freed memory allocations should be
displayed at the end of program execution.  This option must be used in
conjunction with the @option{NOFREE} option and this step will not be performed
if an abnormal termination occurs or if there were no freed allocations.

@cindex SHOWMAP
@item @option{SHOWMAP}
Specifies that a memory map of the entire heap should be displayed at the end of
program execution.  This step will not be performed if an abnormal termination
occurs or if the heap is empty.

@cindex SHOWSYMBOLS
@item @option{SHOWSYMBOLS}
Specifies that a summary of all of the function symbols read from the program's
executable file should be displayed at the end of program execution.  This step
will not be performed if an abnormal termination occurs or if no symbols could
be read from the executable file.

@cindex SHOWUNFREED
@item @option{SHOWUNFREED}
Specifies that a summary of all of the unfreed memory allocations should be
displayed at the end of program execution.  This step will not be performed if
an abnormal termination occurs or if there are no unfreed allocations.

@cindex SMALLBOUND
@item @option{SMALLBOUND}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the limit in bytes up to which memory allocations should be classified
as small allocations for profiling purposes.  This limit must be greater than
zero but less than the medium and large bounds.  Default value:
@option{SMALLBOUND=32}.

@cindex UNFREEDABORT
@item @option{UNFREEDABORT}=<@var{unsigned-integer}>
Specifies the minimum number of unfreed allocations at which to abort the
program just before program termination.  A summary of all the allocations will
be displayed on the standard error file stream before aborting.  This option may
be handy for use in batch tests as it can force tests to fail if they do not
free up a minimum number of memory allocations.  Note that this setting will be
ignored if its value is zero.  Default value: @option{UNFREEDABORT=0}.

@cindex USEDEBUG
@item @option{USEDEBUG}
Specifies that any debugging information in the executable file should be used
to obtain additional source-level information.  This option will only have an
effect if the executable file contains a compiler-generated line number table
and will be ignored if the mpatrol library was built to support an object file
access library that cannot read line tables from object files.  Note that this
option will slow down program execution, use up more system memory and may leave
unaccounted unfreed memory allocations at program termination.

@cindex USEMMAP
@item @option{USEMMAP}
Specifies that the library should use @code{mmap()} instead of @code{sbrk()} to
allocate system memory on UNIX platforms.  This option should be used if there
are problems when using the mpatrol library in combination with another malloc
library which uses @code{sbrk()} to allocate its memory.  It is ignored on
systems that do not support the @code{mmap()} system call.

@cindex mpatrol command

A utility program called @command{mpatrol} is provided to run commands that have
been linked with the mpatrol library.

@smallexample
mpatrol [options] <command> [arguments]
@end smallexample

The @command{mpatrol} command is used to set various mpatrol library
@var{options} when running @var{command} with its @var{arguments}.  In most
cases, @var{command} must have been linked with the mpatrol library, unless the
@option{-d} option is used in which case @var{command} need only have been
dynamically linked.

@cindex process id
All mpatrol library diagnostics are sent to the file @file{mpatrol.%n.log} in
the current directory by default (where @samp{%n} is the current process id) but
this can be changed using the @option{-l} option.  Similarly, the default
profiling output filename is @file{mpatrol.%n.out}.  Note that the
@option{LOGALL} option is always implicitly used for commands that are run by
this command.

Alternatively, the log file and profiling output file names can contain
@samp{%p}, which will be replaced with the name of the program being executed
without the directory components.  If the executable filename could not be
determined or was not set then it will be replaced with @samp{mpatrol}.

The following times were obtained on a Sun Ultra 5 with an UltraSPARC IIi

The format of the profiling output files that are produced by the mpatrol
library is described here.  Every profiling output file contains the following
components.

@itemize @bullet
@item
4 bytes containing the characters @samp{M}, @samp{P}, @samp{T} and @samp{L}.

@item
1 unsigned integer representing the value @samp{1}.  This is used by

profiling output file so that it can decide whether to perform byte-swapping on
the input data.

@item
3 unsigned integers containing the small, medium and large allocation bounds.

@item
1 unsigned integer containing the allocation bin size.  If the allocation bin
size is greater than zero then it is followed by the allocation bins, the large
allocation totals, the deallocation bins and the large deallocation totals,
where the bins are arrays of unsigned integers with dimensions of the allocation
bin size and the totals are unsigned integers.

@item
1 unsigned integer containing the number of profiling data structures.  If the
number of profiling data structures is greater than zero then it is followed by
the profiling data structures themselves, which are of the following structure.

@itemize @bullet
@item
1 unsigned integer representing the index of this profiling data.

@item
4 unsigned integers representing the small, medium, large and extra large

This section contains information about known bugs and limitations in the
mpatrol library as well as listing potential future enhancements.

Bugs should be reported to @email{mpatrol@@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk} along with the
details of the operating system, processor architecture and object file format
that the mpatrol library is being used with --- and don't forget to include the
version of the mpatrol library you are using!  Keep in mind that I only have
access to an Amiga running RedHat Linux/m68k 5.1 and AmigaOS 3.1, so I will be
most likely unable to reproduce most of the system-specific bugs.  A bug report
that comes with an associated fix will be most welcome.

Enhancement requests and source code containing enhancements should also be sent
to @email{mpatrol@@cbmamiga.demon.co.uk} or the mpatrol discussion group at
@uref{http://www.egroups.com/group/mpatrol/}.  If you are planning to implement
an enhancement, let me know first in case I am (or someone else is) working
towards the same goal --- that way, work won't be wasted.  If you wish to send
me source code changes please send the changes as context diffs or in an e-mail
attachment as a compressed tar archive.

@itemize @bullet
@item
C++ support is still fairly limited, and will possibly only work for older C++
code due to the way the operators are overridden (i.e. there are no exceptions
versions of the functions).  There are also likely to be potential problems with
the macros which redefine @code{malloc()} and @code{operator new}, etc., since
there may be member functions in code that will mistakenly be redefined if their
names match the macro definitions, and also means that calls to placement
@code{new} will not work at all.  Also, explicit references to
@code{operator new} rather than @code{new} are likely to result in compilation
errors, and the way that source level information is obtained for
@code{operator delete} means that the resulting code will not be thread-safe.

@item
Need to add support for 64-bit processors.  This shouldn't be too hard, but I
haven't got access to a 64-bit environment to test it, so I haven't bothered
yet.

@item
The thread-safe code in the library doesn't yet work properly, probably because
of the recursion flag which is incremented or decremented before the mutex is
locked.  Hence, the threads test (@file{tests/pass/test5.c}) doesn't work yet.

@item
Need to make the library re-entrant.  This could be achieved by moving the
static variables in @file{memory.c}, @file{stack.c}, @file{mutex.c},
@file{diag.c}, @file{option.c} and @file{sbrk.c} into the @code{infohead}
structure and then having an array of @code{infohead} structures from which to
allocate new memory headers when a new one is required.  This is only necessary
for Amiga shared libraries and Netware NLMs since UNIX and Windows platforms
allocate a new copy of the data section in a shared library or DLL when it is
opened by a new process.

@item
The current implementation of call stack traversal is limited and will only
likely work for unoptimised code.  A much better solution would be write the
implementation at a lower level in assembly, but this is much less portable.
Perhaps there is a library which can be used to perform this across many
operating systems and processor architectures, or maybe someone would like to
write one?  I can think of many applications that would benefit from such a
library besides this one@footnote{The latest release of the GNU C library
includes a @code{backtrace()} function which fills in an array of return
addresses, but this requires the presence of the library and some features of
GCC.}.

@item
An alternative implementation for call stack traversal uses the functions
@code{__builtin_frame_address()} and @code{__builtin_return_address()} that are
available when the library is compiled with @command{gcc}.  However, they can
only traverse a number of stack frames at compile-time, not run-time so there is
a maximum number of stack frames that can be traversed at any one time.  The
implementation depends on both of these builtin functions returning @samp{NULL}
when the top of stack is reached.  If this is not the case then this method
cannot be used or should only be used with a small number of fixed stack frames.

@item
Add a function to display a stack trace of the current call stack to a file
stream and another function to walk all current memory allocations invoking a
call-back function for each one encountered.  Note that there is still an issue
with call-back functions if they call mpatrol library functions, since this
will lead to recursion.

@item
In object file formats that support nested symbols (such as ELF), the current
implementation will tend to show some shortcomings.  This is because there is
currently no nesting count in the function that deals with symbol name lookup,
so the wrong symbol name may be displayed in diagnostics.

@item
In object file formats that don't store the sizes of symbols (such as basic
COFF, or when using the GNU BFD library), the current implementation will simply
assume that the current symbol terminates at the beginning of the next symbol in
the virtual address space.

@item
There still appears to be a problem with the code address to line number mapping
provided by the GNU BFD library, and this needs to be looked into further.  Also
need to store filename and line number information in all call stacks so that
the information can be used at program termination.  May also need to display
this information in the @code{__mp_printinfo()} function and add this
information to the profiling output file so that @command{mprof} can make use of
it.

@item
Perhaps add the ability to profile memory operations such as @code{memcpy()} and
@code{memset()} to the existing memory allocation profiling facility.  Also, add
options to @command{mprof} to write out files that can be used by graph drawing
software for a better visualisation of the profiling information.  Finally,
perhaps add an allocation call graph table to @command{mprof}, similar to that
produced by @command{gprof} for execution call graphs.

@item
Perhaps add a memory usage profiling feature which would dump out memory usage
statistics to a file at set intervals during run-time so that a table of memory
usage could be built up.  This could also be extended to having a graphical
tool which could display this information.

@item
Add a CRC checksum to memory blocks and use it to check that freed memory
allocations have not been corrupted when the @option{NOFREE} and
@option{PRESERVE} options are in use on platforms which have no memory
protection.  This could also be extended to marking allocated memory blocks
and then displaying what blocks have changed after a certain period from within
a debugger.  Another idea could be to display all memory allocations, etc.
made since a certain function was called from within a program.

@item
Improve use of watch points by allowing an option which will only install write
watch points instead of both read and write watch points.  Not only will this
speed up the use of watch points, but will also cause less problems with reading
from misaligned memory allocations.

@item
Perhaps add memory protection to the simulated @code{sbrk} heap.

@item
Add a @option{SHOWFREE} option to display a list of all free memory blocks at
program termination for debugging purposes to view memory fragmentation.  If
that option is added then perhaps @option{SHOWALL} should only be equivalent to
@option{SHOWFREE}, @option{SHOWFREED} and @option{SHOWUNFREED}, and
@option{SHOWMAP} and @option{SHOWSYMBOLS} should be explicitly given.

@item
Add an option, similar to @option{NOFREE}, that would prevent a freed memory
allocation from being used until a certain number of memory allocations later.
This would be far less of a resource-hogger than the @option{NOFREE} option and
might catch just as many errors but might be extremely hard to implement.

@item
Add an extra piece of information in the log file summary which highlights the
peak number of memory allocations in use at any one time during program
execution.

@item
Add versions of @code{mallopt()}, @code{mallinfo()}, @code{memorymap()},
@code{mallocctl()}, @code{mallocblksize()} and @code{msize()} which are provided
in many other malloc libraries.  These won't necessarily behave in exactly the
same way as existing implementations, but at least there won't be link errors
when compiling source code which uses them.

@item
Perhaps add debugging/tracing versions of the string manipulation functions,
such as @code{strlen()} and @code{strcmp()} in much the same way as was done for
the memory operation functions.  The only problem with this would be locale
support, but perhaps it might be easier just to assume the C locale to begin
with.  Also need to have better detection of internal and free blocks when
displaying memory range errors.

@item
Perhaps add definitions of @code{xmalloc()}, @code{xrealloc()}, etc. which never
return @samp{NULL} on failure, and perhaps also add definitions of
@code{XtMalloc()}, @code{XtRealloc()}, etc. for X-Window programming.  Some
other malloc libraries provide versions of these but perhaps they are not needed
if they are implemented using @code{malloc()}, @code{realloc()}, etc.

@item
Add another library which can be linked in instead of mpatrol and replaces
all calls to @code{__mp_alloc()}, etc., with the original calls to
@code{malloc()} and related functions.  This would be very useful for quickly
removing all mpatrol functionality for perhaps even a release build, and might
be useful for implementing functions such as @code{memalign()} which don't
exist on many systems.

@item
Write a set of functions that are compatible with those implemented by Checker,
the @command{gcc} run-time memory access checker.  This would allow every memory
access to be checked in object files compiled with @command{gcc}, not just
pointers into the heap, and would provide error checking as effective as source
code instrumentation.  Could also make use of the @code{etext}, @code{edata} and
@code{end} pointers that are set at run-time on most UNIX systems.

@item
Perhaps remove the automatic logging of memory operations from programs run
through the @command{mpatrol} command, and instead add an option to do it
explicitly.

@item
Add an option to specify that all failed memory allocations should abort (or at
least give a warning) instead of returning a @samp{NULL} pointer.  Also, perhaps
add an option to display the partial contents of freed and unfreed allocations
in the mpatrol log file.

@item
Perhaps use GNU autoconf to automatically work out values for @file{config.h} on
the platform it is being built on, and also use automake, libtool and install
when building and installing files.

@item
The postscript version of the quick reference card seems to print at an unusual
offset on some printers.  Also, the PDF version gets created with 1 inch margins
rather than half inch margins which means that it is one inch too large in both
dimensions.  Need to figure out what is happening in both cases.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Need to add watch point area support for non-Solaris operating systems.  This
may be a case of preventing all heap memory from being accessed and providing a
signal handler that is called when a read from or write to such memory triggers
a signal.  The handler could then determine if the address is in a watch point,
and if it is not it could unprotect the memory and return.

@item
Need to improve watch point facility in order to speed it up by an order of
magnitudes.  This will most likely involve removing all watch points when
entering the library and replacing them when returning to user code.

@item
Need to add advanced signal information for operating systems that do not
support the @code{siginfo()} system call.  This information is used by the
signal handler that handles the @code{SIGSEGV} signal in order to provide useful
information about where an illegal memory access occurred.  However, there is
currently a problem in that the call stack displayed from within that handler is
not necessarily accurate with respect to the function at the top of the stack.
Also, signal handlers shouldn't technically call I/O functions in case of
additional signals being caught so this may need to be improved.

@item
Need to add a portable way of initialising the thread-safe version of the
library when it is compiled by a C compiler.  There is already a solution to
this problem when it is compiled by a C++ compiler, but it may only work if the
final program is linked with that specific compiler.

@item
Need to add support for call stack traversal for at least the Alpha, MIPS,
PA/RISC, PowerPC and RS/6000 processor architectures.  The current
implementation of call stack traversal for the Motorola 88xx0 family is also a
bit flaky and so should only be used when the library and program are built
unoptimised.

@item
Need to add support for obtaining the program name from the stack for at least
the Alpha, Motorola 88xx0, non-IRIX MIPS, PA/RISC, PowerPC and RS/6000 processor
architectures.  Also need to add support for reading the program symbols from
a suitable file in @file{/proc} for other operating systems that support it.
If there is no support for either of these methods then the @option{PROGFILE}
option can currently be used to specify the program name at run-time.

@item
The library cannot currently read any symbols from shared objects that have been
read via @code{dlopen()}.  Also, on IRIX platforms no symbols can currently be
read from any shared libraries that were used by a program.  This is because SGI
have a slightly different interface to their dynamic linker that I haven't been
able to figure out yet.

@item
There is a problem on later Linux releases where the @code{_DYNAMIC} symbol
is defined in @file{elf.h}, thus resulting in a conflicting definition when
compiling @file{symbol.c}.

@item
The @option{-d} option to the @command{mpatrol} command does not always work on
systems whose dynamic linkers support the @env{LD_PRELOAD} or @env{_RLD_LIST}
environment variables.  This is because the object file format access libraries
do not exist in shared form on such systems.  There is also likely to be an
issue when running with thread-safe libraries.

@item
Perhaps add support for building mpatrol as an Amiga shared library.  I
attempted to do this in a previous release of mpatrol, but it would have
involved too many source changes to get working fully.  Perhaps it's not even
worth implementing as the archive library works fine.

@item
Need to add proper support for call stack traversal for both the Motorola 680x0
and PowerPC processor architectures.  When @command{gcc} is being used then
up to two stack frames can be traversed, but this should really be extended
without requiring @code{MP_BUILTINSTACK_SUPPORT}.  When SAS/C is being used then
there is no support for call stack traversal.

@item
Need to add proper support for reading symbols from Amiga executable files.
When @command{gcc} is being used then the BFD library routines will be called
to determine the symbols from the executable file, but this will only work for
objects compiled with @command{gcc}.  When SAS/C is being used then there is no
support for reading symbols from executable files.  Also need to add support for
reading symbols from any shared libraries that are required by the program.

@item
Possibly make use of other software such as Enforcer, Mungwall or MuLib in order
to provide some form of memory protection.  The features of SegTracker could
also be put to good use so that the file and hunk location of entries on the
call stack could be determined.

@item
When using SAS/C it is currently not possible to override the definition of
@code{malloc()}, etc., without including the @file{mpatrol.h} header file first.
This is because the compiler startup code and libraries call @code{malloc()}
before everything is set up, and so the library cannot properly initialise
itself if the @code{malloc()} that the startup code finds is the @code{malloc()}
in the mpatrol library.  This restriction does not exist when using
@command{gcc}.

The library has not yet been built (let alone tested) on Netware platforms.  The
names of the system functions that the library calls for Netware were obtained
by looking at Novell's developer documentation, so they may not even compile
correctly without modification.

@item
Need to add support for building the mpatrol library as an NLM.  This is not
currently a high priority requirement as the archive library should suffice for
most purposes.

@item
Need to add way to determine when the base of the stack has been reached during
call stack traversal, since on Netware every application is really a thread
running under one large process.

@item
Need to add support for reading symbols from Netware load modules.  Also need to
add support for reading symbols from any NLMs that are required by the program.
This may be possible in a limited fashion by using the GNU BFD library, but may
only work with code compiled with @command{gcc}.

@item
Need to investigate if it is safe (or even possible) to override the definitions
of @code{malloc()}, etc., without including the @file{mpatrol.h} header file
first.  Currently, non-macro definitions for these functions have been disabled
in the Netware version of the library in case they affect other NLMs that are
currently running.

@cindex Solaris 7 malloc libraries
@cindex malloc libraries for Solaris 7
However, before you try out any of the above software, there may already be a
malloc library with debugging support on your system that might be suitable for
solving your problem.  For example, on Solaris 7 the following libraries are
available:

@table @cite
@cindex malloc(3c)
@item malloc(3c)
Trade-off between performance and efficiency.
@cindex malloc(3x)
@item malloc(3x)
Slower performance, space-efficient.
@cindex bsdmalloc(3x)
@item bsdmalloc(3x)
Better performance, space-inefficient.
@cindex mtmalloc(3t)
@item mtmalloc(3t)
Thread-safe memory allocator.
@cindex mapmalloc(3x)
@item mapmalloc(3x)
Uses @code{mmap()} instead of @code{sbrk()} to allocate heap space.
@cindex watchmalloc(3x)
@item watchmalloc(3x)
Uses watch point areas to check for overflows.
@end table

@cindex GNU C library
On platforms with the GNU C library, such as Linux, there are several
environment variables that can be used to enable various debugging features of
@code{malloc()}, etc.  There are also extra functions provided in the library
which can be used to aid in debugging, and some shell scripts which can
translate return addresses or locate unfreed memory allocations in the log files
produced.  Useful information on the debugging features available within the
GNU C library is located at @uref{http://sdb.suse.de/sdb/en/html/aj_debug.html}.
