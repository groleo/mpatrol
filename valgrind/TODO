TODO:

 * The overloading of the functions is done only in the program to
   check. To pass the file name of the program to check to the DLL
   that is doing the API hooking, the memory tool checker is writing
   in the file %USERPROFILE%/.valgrind the full name of the program to
   check. The DLL retrieve it and compare it to the ame of the
   processes that are running. When it is found, API hooking is
   done. If there is a better way to pass data from a binary to a DLL
   that is loaded by LoadLibrary, then it must be implemented.

 * Split the code so that the overloaded functions are in a separate
   file, and generally, clean the code.

 * Add C runtime functions (malloc and al) to that framework. Problem:
   we have to know which dll is used : msvcrt.dll ? msvcr**.dll ? (** is
   the version of the used C runtime DLL). So the DLL that are run by
   the program to test must be enumerated, and we check their name
   with all the possible names of a C runtime DLL.
